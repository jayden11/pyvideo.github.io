&lt;p&gt;Plone is a Document Management System and Content Management System
that has been in the Python scope for more than 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plone 5â€™s features allow us to manage content, define various kinds of
content and provide a nice useful UI to work on semantic web
technologies. In this talk we are going to explain our approach for
using Plone with the Python machine learning toolkit sklearn (http
://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to enable clusterization and
classification of content using a scalable content management system.
We will also add some sophisticated front-end gloss using the new
functionalities on frontend development added on Plone 5 and some real
use cases of CMS/DMS with machine learning using sklean and solr.&lt;/p&gt;
