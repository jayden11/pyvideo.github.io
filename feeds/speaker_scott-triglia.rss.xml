[EuroPython 2016]

[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

&lt;p&gt;Failures are the bane of scaling a modern web service and can cause
serious pain for end users! Lucky for us, there are techniques that
can help protect your product and handle failures in subsystems
gracefully. This talk will dive into one of these in depth, the
Circuit Breaker pattern, and explore the options it gives us for
keeping all our users safe. We will be focusing on several real-world
problems and options for how to implement your circuit breaker setup
in nice, readable python code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inevitability of failures is the bane of scaling any modern web
service and can cause serious pain for end users! Lucky for us, there
are techniques that can help protect your product handle failures in
subsystems gracefully. This talk will dive into one of these in depth,
the Circuit Breaker pattern, and explore the options it gives us for
keeping our users safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be focusing on several real-world problems and how they can be
addressed by circuit breakers. You should expect to leave the talk
with details on simple circuit breakers as well as understanding how
they can be adapted for more complex situations. We’ll also discuss
some options for how to implement your circuit breaker in readable
python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contrived FAQ time!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t know what Circuit Breakers are, should I come?&lt;/strong&gt;
Definitely! We’re going to start from scratch and work our way up.
Only requirement is basic familiarity with backend services receiving
and making HTTP requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I totally know what Circuit Breakers are, should I come?&lt;/strong&gt;
Definitely! After the intro, the main meat of the talk will be working
through a series of more advanced situations and talking about how we
can alter the basic circuit breaker setup to address them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want real-world advice, not made up hypotheticals!&lt;/strong&gt;
Well that’s not really a question, but you’ll be happy to know that
the examples we’ll discuss come straight from my experience at Yelp.
They should be very realistic and broadly applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

You may not understand it, you may wonder how it works at all! It is the type of code most developers do their best to stay away from, and for good reason. So what is there to do when you inherit such a system for the first time? How can you take it from unknown mess to gleaming example of excellent engineering? What is unique about legacy systems written in Python?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will present a series of tools, both technical and social, for rehabilitating unknown, untested, and maybe even unloved systems. Approaches to improving these systems will primarily focus on refactoring and testing, with sidebars on engineering culture and personal motivation. We will reference Michael Feathers's excellent book on the topic, but also depart significantly to discuss particular challenges and opportunities presented by the Python language. After all, much of the written literature on this topic assumes a fairly Java-centric view of the world, and offers little support when you realize that object you thought was a dict is actually an ORM model that just happens to support getattr lookup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intended audience is someone relatively new to professional programming, who is encountering their first legacy codebase. This talk will be a crash course in how to handle your unknown adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

So
much so that Yelp's Transaction Platform committed from the start to an
architecture of small, cooperative microservices. This talk explores the
inevitable complications that arise in successful projects based on
microservices as they grow larger and stretch both their own
architecture and the developers responsible for them. Come hear tales of
terror (tight coupling! low test coverage!), stories which will warm
your heart (agility! strong interfaces!), and everything in between as
we follow the adventures of our plucky team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will be focused on the functional, cultural, and reliability
challenges which occur as a microservices-based project evolves and
expands over time. Particular attention will be paid to where these
diverge from the utopian way microservices are often described, and to
the practical approaches your project can take to mitigate issues and
avoid the traps inherent in scaling up this type of approach. My goal is
to share with attendees some mistakes we've made, some successful
methods for growing gracefully, and above all with useful (and maybe
unexpected!) lessons from the trenches they can apply to their own work.&lt;/p&gt;
