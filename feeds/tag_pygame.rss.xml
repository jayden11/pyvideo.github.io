Mac &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lo sviluppo di un emulatore di videogiochi è tra le cose più divertenti
che un programmatore può fare davanti ad un monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante questo talk mostrerò come emulare un sistema relativamente
semplice, il Chip-8, realizzando tutto l'emulatore in Python ed
appoggiandomi solo a pygame come libreria grafica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al termine del talk avrete imparato quali sono i concetti base necessari
per scrivere un emulatore, e non vedrete l'ora di realizzarne uno per il
vostro sistema preferito.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Brian Thorne&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An introduction to computer vision in Python, from the general concept
to its implementation with some current open-source libraries (opencv,
scipy, pygame).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of my presentation is an introduction to computer vision
(CV) and image processing in Python. I will aim to show what is possible
with current libraries, demonstrate their usability, explore their
limitations, and cover elements of best coding practice. Firstly, I will
briefly present the basics, such as video grabbing, image processing and
computer vision algorithms. I will illustrate my presentation with the
Python bindings to the opencv library and show different examples such
as displaying a video image, some filtering algorithms (dilation,
gaussian blur), and how to implement facial recognition. I will describe
after how related tasks can be achieved with other Python tools such as
scipy and pygame. I will show how these three libraries can be used in
conjunction to perform video capturing, image processing and user
interfacing. Finally, I will introduce my basic Python computer vision
framework, which is aimed at inexperienced users, and demonstrate it on
the XO laptop, the inexpensive low-powered sub-notebook distributed as
part of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Douglas Bagnall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetuhi is a python program that turns drawings on paper into 2D top-down
early 80s style video games. This talk describes how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Te Tuhi Video Game System is not a game in itself; rather it creates
games based on arbitrary images that it is given. To use it, you draw a
picture of the game you want to play, and it will give you the game that
you really drew. The software was originally written for an art exhibit
using slightly specialised hardware, but it has been released under the
GPL and runs on ordinary computers. It uses Pygame, PIL, and custom C
extensions that allow it to evolve a playable game from a wide variety
of pictures. This talk will discuss the techniques used (both refined
algorithms and hacky heuristics) and cover topics such as image
analysis, machine learning, and interface design. There will be a
demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;

user-created-content platform video game written in Pygame. It's a bit
like a cross between a wiki and a game, because the players can also
create and edit the levels. In this talk we will look at the development
of the game over the last three years, including what has changed since
PyCon 2010. We'll examine the sound, graphics, and networking
architecture which is built upon pygame and asyncore (PodSixNet).&lt;/p&gt;
