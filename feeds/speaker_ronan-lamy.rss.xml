&lt;p&gt;PyPy is a fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language (2.7.6 and 3.2.5). I will give an overview of the current status of and the on-going development efforts on all the pieces that combine to make it a compelling Python platform. In particular, I will mention the RPython toolchain, CFFI, the JIT, garbage collection, the numpy port, Python 3 support, software transactional memory.&lt;/p&gt;

PyPy is an alternative implementation of Python. It is notorious for
being fast, but also for using clever algorithms pertaining to advanced
concepts such as type inference, garbage collection, just-in-time
compilation, etc. So, can we, mediocre programmers, realistically use
PyPy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, absolutely. In fact, PyPy developers did all that hard work so that
we wouldn't have to. As we'll see, it runs most Python code exactly like
CPython does, save that it magically makes it faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porting existing applications is always more involved than running a
simple script, so we'll also examine likely difficulties such as code
relying on CPython implementation details, and dependencies on C
extensions, and explore simple principles to let PyPy run your code even
faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll have a glimpse of the future by looking at what's brewing
in the PyPy lair, such as software transactional memory, new speed
optimisations, better support for Python 3 and NumPy, ...&lt;/p&gt;

Its just-in-time compiler, backed by a state-of-the art garbage collector, allow it to run pure-Python(2) code on average 7 times faster than CPython 2.7, the reference implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will give a tour of PyPy's goals, history and features with special emphasis on recent developments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cpyext, PyPy's emulation layer for CPython's C API, has been overhauled in order to soon allow full compatibility with all C extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python 3 support is steadily improving with a recent 3.3-compatible release and development being started on a 3.5 version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
