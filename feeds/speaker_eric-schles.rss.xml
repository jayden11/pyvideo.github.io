The only background required is an understanding of Python, basic linear algebra and calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

The industry
commands 32 billion dollars in annual revenue a year (source: polaris
project). As a professor and researcher at NYU I am developing tools to
fight this horrible problem. Come learn about the work I've done so far
and where my research is going. I will be showing you how recreate some
of the tools I've made and used in python. I will be covering web
scraping, text processing, and image processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be taking folks through a number of web scraping tools that I use
to find instances of human trafficking. We will then go through
classification algorithms I use to determine genuine instances of
trafficking. Finally I will discuss image processing and facial
recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

social good. There is an increasing need for data science, automation,
search and distributed computation. In this talk I will take listeners
through a number of general purpose tools including, building a image
search database with python and a few libraries, how to build geographic
information systems with geodjango, and how to process and extract
information from pdfs.&lt;/p&gt;
