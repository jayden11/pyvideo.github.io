[EuroPython 2015]
[21 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what your application did last night? Python logging can help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk you will show you how to implement a systematic logging
approach without boilerplate code and how to set up the Python logging
module for different needs in production systems.  We will see how to
work with log files and other logging endpoints.  We will address the
data protection concerns that come up when logging  from application
with personal  information. We will also look at the performance
implications of logging. We will then cover best practices - how to
structure logging, what to include in a log message, and how to
configure logging for different use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use the Python standard logging module to implement logging.
This talk is useful to beginners with some experience.  An
understanding of decorators is useful, but not required.  Some
experience in web programming is a plus.&lt;/p&gt;
