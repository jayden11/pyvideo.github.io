From blinking LEDs to a bike speedometer with MicroPython</title><link>http://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2017/look-mum-no-hands-from-blinking-leds-to-a-bike-speedometer-with-micropython.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will show you how to use a micro-controller to build a
wifi enabled speedometer for your bike, using MicroPython. And some
hardware. And a bike (maybe). I will introduce you to the world of
MicroPython: a python distribution that runs on micro-controllers.
Micro-controllers are small computers that are all around us: in cars,
TVs, and your internet connected fridge. We will start with making LEDs
blink, then serve webpages, build an interrupt handler and finally put
it all together to make a wifi enabled speedometer for a bike.&lt;/p&gt;
