&lt;p&gt;Audience level: Intermediate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most websites share at least two things in common: content and users who
want to find content. This talk will cover the basics of site search
using search engines (the kind you run, not Google), setting up a Django
project with Haystack, highlight some of the gotchas you might
encounter, and touch on some more advanced functionality. Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to find content on a site is important to users, and there
are some great tools that make a sometimes tricky problem a lot simpler.
This talk will address the search problem, introduce a few of the tools
at your disposal, and provide a way to get started using Django
Haystack.&lt;/p&gt;

about using a search engine as an additional service, to be aware of
some of the &amp;quot;gotchas&amp;quot;, and to know not just what's possible but how to
get started. Advanced topics in brief One slice at a time: Faceting
Finding Carmen Diego: Geospatial search This, this, this: Relevance
