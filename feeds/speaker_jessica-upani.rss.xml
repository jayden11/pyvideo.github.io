&lt;p&gt;Everything from a lack of teachers to dysfunctional computer labs has led to a loss of interest in Junior Computer studies learners registering for the subject in their senior grades. These has led to yet a bigger problem which is what I want to address in my talk. PYNAM is short for Python Namibia. It is a Python programming society. We established PYNAM during the Feb 2015 PyCon Namibia conference. We primarily aim at bringing the Python Community in Namibia together and to promote Python to the young children through our school outreach programs. This year we are hosting a first ever programming day where the learners get to showcase their software and also raise money to help fix the computer lab at the school. My talk will report about the programs that the learners will create, the whole experience of developing the systems and organizing the event.&lt;/p&gt;

have just started having python events in their countries and I would
like to share what steps we are taking to ensure that we are not just
organizing these events but we are also taking necessary steps to ensure
that in the future we are actually really developing the skills of the
new developers in our nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will serve as motivation and it will give a sense of direction for
these developing countries. In the end we are hoping to motivate more
countries to follow our steps. We need to show each other support and
share our actions, this will serve that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk does not need any expertise. It will benefit both new
organizers as well as experienced organizers who have not taken some of
these steps already.&lt;/p&gt;
