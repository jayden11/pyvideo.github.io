text data is messy. For example, shorthand and abbreviated text are
common in various data sets. In addition, outputs from OCR or voice to
text conversions tend to be messy or imperfect. Thus, we want to be able
to make the most of our data by extrapolating as much information as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will explore the various approaches used in fuzzy
string matching and demonstrate how they can be used as a feature in a
model or a component in your python code. We will dive deep into the
approaches of different algorithms such as Soundex, Trigram/n-gram
search, and Levenshtein distances and what the best use cases are. We
will also discuss situations where itâ€™s important to take into account
the meaning or intent of a word and demonstrate approaches for measuring
semantic similarity using nltk and word2vec. Furthermore, we will
demonstrate via live coding how to implement some of these fuzzy search
algorithms using python and/or built-in fuzzy search functions within
PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of data science is about understanding the context around your data. In this talk, we hope to address how to work with messy text data by leveraging fuzzy search algorithms in python or against a database such as PostgreSQL. We will talk specifically about fuzzy algorithms such as Soundex, Trigram/n-gram search, and Levenshtein distances and demonstrate use cases in an ipython notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
