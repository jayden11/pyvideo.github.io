We're aware of that.
However, it's not always clear how we can follow abstract ideals like
elegance, simplicity, and extensibility to improve our APIs. That's why
in this talk we'll discuss good and bad APIs with real-world examples.
For each thing learned, we'll come up with a checklist to help us with
practical advice for writing good APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
