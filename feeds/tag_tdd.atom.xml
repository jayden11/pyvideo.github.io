&lt;p&gt;An intermediate-level Test-Driven-Development workshop, presented as a hands-on exploration of &amp;quot;&amp;quot;outside-in&amp;quot;&amp;quot; TDD, in the style of a code-dojo code kata.  Will include discussion of &amp;quot;&amp;quot;double-loop&amp;quot;&amp;quot; BDD/TDD, outside-in vs inside-out, a detailed discussion of the pros + cons of mocking, test isolation, letting the tests drive design, and what are tests for anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live demo of writing code and tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This live demo is intended for people that have not seen test driven
development in action before. See what a failing test should look like.
And then I'll attempt to write some code to make that test pass so that
you can see what a successful test run looks like - I may need some help
from the audience at that point. Along the way you'll see various
features of the test framework 'nose' in action and even some doctests.
This will be a second attempt of the stunt first performed:

that they &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; somehow be doing Test Driven Development (TDD)
because &amp;quot;everybody else&amp;quot; is and it's cool, somewhere between necessary
and useful and they heard testing was good. When informed that must of
TDD isn't about testing (despite the name!), confusion reigns. Behaviour
Driven Development is a different way of approaching the &amp;quot;how to
validate your code&amp;quot; problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Laurens Van Houtven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about continuous deployment practices and tools, lessons
learned from implementing it, and putting them into perspective. The
goal is to give other people tips and pointers for applying these ideas
themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous deployment is the practice of putting the latest revision of
software into production use all the time, as opposed to working towards
larger releases. The important difference is iteration time: whereas
large software packages produce new software in timeframes of years or
months, continuous deployment teams typically put new code into
production in timeframes of hours or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice is slowly attracting a small but growing group of loyal
followers, just like continuous integration over the past few years and
test- driven development did before that. They can be explained in terms
of being natural extensions of each other. Like TDD and CI, CD gets eyed
somewhat suspiciously (and rightfully so: skeptical analysis is great),
but the undersigned believes there's a legitimate advantage for many
applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, TTD and testing tools in general were mostly ad-hockery.
Now, with many different production-quality testing tools, this has
become unthinkable. Similarly, continuous integration was something
other people did for a long time, but now we have tools such as Buildbot
and Hudson. Continuous deployment is still somewhat in the early stage
in terms of ready-to-use tools, but it's likely that we'll see a similar
evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a rough outline of what I plan to cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a short history of people developed software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;from the recent models to CD (sort of a working definition of CD
here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when is it a good idea? pros/cons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requirements &amp;amp; battle plan for applying CD in an existing development
environment (and possibly code base)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an overview of existing tools and how they work together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;caveat emptors, known pitfalls (deployment and recovery strategies go
here, since most implementations figure out they need them after
stuff blows up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;questions! (hopefully lots of people who've tried or are thinking
about implementing something similar -- like I said, there are a lot
of people implementing it but not too many ideas being bounced
around)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
