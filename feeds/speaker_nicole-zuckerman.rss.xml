of our time to wait for code to complete execution and write print
messages to stdout. There’s one function in particular in the python
debugger (pdb) library that can give you a much clearer understanding of
what’s going on in your code, much more quickly; pdb.set_ trace(). In
this talk, we’ll identify the most useful things you can do when you use
set trace, that can make debugging exponentially more efficient and
enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

independent and productive members of your engineering team faster and
cheaper. We will focus on python specific resources and libraries that
will help you create a simple but effective on boarding program, and
talk about case studies of companies that have had success using these
techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

be of supreme importance for the people who use the things we build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you'll learn about essential topics in web security,
and you will gain hands-on practice identifying and leveraging
vulnerabilities in a Python-based web app. For each issue, we will cover
how your code can stay on the side of safety.&lt;/p&gt;
