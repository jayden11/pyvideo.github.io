building agents: software that can robustly achieve a desired objective
under varying states of the world. This introduction will provide you
with an overview of RL and tools to build your own agents. In this talk,
we will provide an overview of terminology in reinforcement learning and
a Jupyter Notebook outlining basic algorithms to learn 'policies',
strategies for an agent, and visualize them with numpy, pandas, and
seaborn. Newer developments in reinforcement learning apply deep
learning to improve performance. We will further discuss deep
reinforcement learning and how to use deep learning libraries, such as
TensorFlow or Theano, with the latest RL libraries: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gym.openai.com"&gt;OpenAI

In this talk, we will provide an overview of terminology in reinforcement learning and sample Python programs for basic algorithms to learn policies.  We will also discuss the state of the art in reinforcement learning and the ways in which reinforcement learning can be applied to real world problems.&lt;/p&gt;
