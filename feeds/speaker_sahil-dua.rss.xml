It will mainly focus on exploring the most commonly used features of the library like – integrated indexing using DataFrame objects, slicing and subsetting of large data sets, merging, joining and size mutability of data structures, hierarchical axis indexing to work with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data, flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets etc.&lt;/p&gt;
