&lt;p&gt;You work for weeks, maybe months, on a new analysis: collecting data,
cleaning it, extracting your features and modeling it, and you finally
come up with some meaningful results... What happens next? How many
people dig into and explore your work and your results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bokeh is a data visualization library that gives you the power of
custom interactive visualizations that you can publish on the web, but
lets you build them in python.&lt;/p&gt;

interactive dashboard that can run a clustering algorithm from a

&lt;p&gt;As a web developer, I find myself being asked to make increasing
numbers of data visualizations, interactive infographics, and more.
d3.js is great, as are many other javascript toolkits that are out
there. But if I can write more Python and less JavaScript... well,
that makes me happy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bokeh is a new Python library for interactive visualization. Its
origins are in the data science community, but it has a lot to offer
web developers. In this mini-tutorial, I'll run through how to build a
data visualization in Bokeh and how to hook it into your web
application. This will be a real-world example, that was previously
built in d3.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, I'll provide tips and tricks that I've discovered in my
experience including how Bokeh works wonderfully with the iPython
notebook which I use to prototype my visualizations, and many data
science people use as their native way to explore data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who already know a little Bokeh, I'll be covering the
new &amp;quot;actions framework&amp;quot; that lets you write JS callbacks in your
python code so you can do lots of interactions all on the client side.&lt;/p&gt;

stronghold. The new Python library, Bokeh, provides a simple, clean way
to make more shiny things. Although it comes from the data science
community, it has a lot to offer web developers. For a visualization you
might have built in d3.js, I'll show how to build it in Bokeh, how to
test it, and how to hook it into your web app.&lt;/p&gt;
