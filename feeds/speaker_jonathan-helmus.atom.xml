Conda can be used to package and distribute software written in any language but has first class support for Python packages. This talk will briefly cover how to use conda to install and manage data science packages as well as how conda can be used to create isolated computing environments. The main focus of the talk will be an in-depth look at how to easily and reproducibly create conda packages for your own Python software, and options for how to share these packages with others. Finally, combining a collection of conda packages into custom cross-platform installable conda-based Python distributions will be explored.&lt;/p&gt;

scientific data. Although packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and pandas can
offer execution speeds similar to those possible using statically typed,
compiled languages, oftentimes Python code is too slow for the task at
hand. Cython is a static compiler for Python which, with the addition of
a few type declarations, allows Python code to execute at significantly
faster speeds. This talk will detail how to use Cython to optimize the
run time of Python code for analysis of scientific data with examples
taken from the development of algorithms in the Python ARM Radar Toolkit
(Py-ART), an open source library for working with weather radar data in
Python.&lt;/p&gt;
