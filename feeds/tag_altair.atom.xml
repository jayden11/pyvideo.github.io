&lt;p&gt;Announcement of Altair, Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python. Altair is developed by Brian Granger and Jake Vanderplas in close collaboration with the UW Interactive Data Lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Altair, you can spend more time understanding your data and its meaning. Altair's API is simple, friendly and consistent and built on top of the powerful Vega-Lite JSON specification. This elegant simplicity produces beautiful and effective visualizations with a minimal amount of code.&lt;/p&gt;
