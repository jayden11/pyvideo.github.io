Be it square or square
root, exp, log, tanh, or the complex roots of unity, ** has it's work
cut out. Ints, floats, fractions, and zero don't play nice with **.
Precision, accuracy, and performance aspects of Python can be revealed
by following ** thru the interpreter down to the metal. SciPy, SymPy,
and Machine Learners care, shouldn't you?&lt;/p&gt;

Only up to a
point. In reality, Real numbers don't really exist, there are only a
finite number of Integers, negative zero is not always the same as
positive zero, and Complex numbers really are. All of which make
exponentiation both subtle and computationally expensive. A
retrospective and prospective of the intricacies of reification of
'number' and the occasional futility of mathematical operations in
particular, **.&lt;/p&gt;

We have
used Python to build a tool, ASL-CLeaR (American Sign Language Concept
Learning Resource) for the DHH community which will teach STEM
terminology using ASL exclusively. We are also building a summer program
to teach Python in English/ASL to DHH students.&lt;/p&gt;
