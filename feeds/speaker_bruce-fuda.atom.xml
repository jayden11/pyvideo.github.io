One of the greatest advantages the teaching of the Digital Technologies has over most other schooling disciplines is the ease and speed with which students can see the result of their learning. New knowledge and skills go from being concepts they've never seen before to working code and applications very quickly, resources to assist them are everywhere, and feedback throughout the learning process is immediate. This presentation demonstrates some of the work graduating students from my Year 12 class have produced in their final year - projects that demonstrate mastery of computer science concepts like path finding, Bayesian spam filters, Markov chain-based predictive text generators and Artificial Intelligence algorithms. With the right support and guidance, students can go from programming novices to Python ninjas in a time frame as short as two years. Come along and see what high school students are capable of, and how we can help them get there!&lt;/p&gt;

Teaching programming has always been a challenge given the lack of experience, understanding and knowledge students in schools generally have about what is involved and what it means to be studying &amp;quot;IT&amp;quot;. It hasn't been helped by a lack of robust curriculum in most states and territories in Australia. With the recent endorsement of the Australian Curriculum: Digital Technologies, most states and territories have implementation timelines as early as 2017, and this means that teachers (and those who want to support them in their classrooms) now have an obligation to deliver ambitious, engaging and rigorous learning activities in their classrooms. Having been in the enviable situation of being supported and encouraged to design and implement innovative computer science curricula for students in years 6-12, I'll be sharing the reasons why I choose to use Python as my primary teaching language in high school, and identify the tips, tricks and traps teachers need to watch out for when using it as the basis for learning not just programming skills, but computational thinking more generally. This includes an explanation of the importance of a project-driven approach, and demonstration of the techniques I use and projects my students work on in class.&lt;/p&gt;
