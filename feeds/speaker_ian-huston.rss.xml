for the success of a project between team members. Each team member
has specific obligations to the team and a specific area of authority.
Until recently, designers, product managers and developers were the
usual team members considered. In this talk I will explore how data
scientists can function in a balanced team and discuss my experience
working as a data scientist on balanced teams at Pivotal Labs with our
global clients. I will consider what obligations and authority a data
scientist can provide as part of a balanced team and how this
situation differs from the usual jack-of-all-trades type data science
work. I will outline specific examples where data science can help
user centric design and product management, and where the practices of
lean-startup and agile development can help accelerate analysis and
data science. Based on my experience building data science driven
products with a global bank and European car manufacturers, I will
outline what we tried, what worked and most importantly what didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a data scientist or need to work with one, this talk will
equip you to understand how data science can be an integral part of a
balanced team.&lt;/p&gt;
