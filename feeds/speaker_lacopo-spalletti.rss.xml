&lt;p&gt;Lacopo Spalletti&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CMS websites are usually kind of boring: get a request, pick data from storage, stamp them on a template and return to the client. This is less and less suitable for the current web experience, and more advanced and flexible architecture are needed: what if we mix the best CMS for Django with the real time web technologies? We'll end up with the best of both worlds: this talk will show how to use a few applications and techniques to achieve this goal. I'll show how to integrate django CMS with django channels, a REST API and an Angular JS client in a fully featured SPA managed by django CMS.&lt;/p&gt;
