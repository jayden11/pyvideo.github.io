number of solid data driven libraries. This talk will be a high
introduction to familiarize people interested in data science with some
of the more common Python tools such as pandas for data munging and
analysis, numpy for scientific computing, scikit-learn for machine
learning and matplotlib for visualizing your data.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will help bring this topic to light by discussing things that can cause imposter syndrome and ways of coping and getting through these bumps.&lt;/p&gt;
