&lt;p&gt;One of the refreshing trends in software engineering has been the increase of people moving into the field later in life, from non traditional backgrounds (graduating as a 22 year old with a BS in computer science, for example). As someone who does indeed fall into that category, I want to talk about my experiences as a junior developer, after I've been working for a few years, and express my thoughts and feelings on a later in life transition to software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
