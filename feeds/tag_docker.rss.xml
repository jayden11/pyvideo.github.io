Will go over architecture, show code, and discuss pain points as well as next steps.  #pyconjamaica2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We present the evolution of a model to a production API that can scale to large e-commerce needs. On the journey we discuss metrics of success and how to use the Kubernetes cluster manager and associated tools for deploy. In addition to the use of these tools we highlight how to make use of the cluster management system for further testing and experimentation with your models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chasm between data science and dev ops is often wide and impenetrable, but the two fields have more in common than meets the eye. Every data scientist will be able to lean in and help their career by investing in a basic understanding the basic principles of dev ops. In this talk I present the notions of service level indicators, objectives, and agreements. I cover the rigorous monitoring and testing of services. Finally we demonstrate how to build a basic data science workflow and push to production level APIs with Docker and Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is an opinionated container cluster manager with an easy to use, robust interface. It can be use on very small and very large clusters. Docker is a container system that allows one to build code in an isolated environment. Paired with a container manager such as Kubernetes we are able to manage millions of instances as needed for a production deployment. These tools are two of many different options but are considered among the best open source solutions available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will introduce Palladium, an open source framework for setting up predictive analytics services. It supports tasks like fitting, evaluating, storing, and distributing (predictive) models. Core ML processes are compatible with scikit-learn and a large number of scikit-learn’s features can be used. Besides the use of Palladium we will also show how to use it with Docker and Mesos / Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will introduce Palladium, an open source framework for easily setting up predictive analytics services (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ottogroup/palladium"&gt;https://github.com/ottogroup/palladium&lt;/a&gt;). It supports tasks like fitting, evaluating, storing, distributing, and updating (predictive) models. Core machine learning processes are compatible with the open source machine learning library scikit-learn and thus, a large number of scikit-learn’s features can be used with Palladium. Although being implemented in Python, Palladium provides support for other languages and is shipped with examples how to integrate and expose R and Julia models. For an efficient deployment of services based on Palladium, a script to create Docker images automatically is provided. This talk will cover the use of Palladium including an example where a simple classification service is set up. We will also show how Docker and Mesos / Marathon can be used to deploy and scale Palladium-based services. Having basic knowledge about Machine Learning and/or scikit-learn would be an advantage when attending this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

wrap up your app and everything it needs to run: code, runtime, and even
system libraries and guarantee that it will always run the same,
regardless of the environment (local machine, server, or even the
cloud). Whether you're deploying a web app, performing data analysis, or
creating local environments for your dev team or CI builds, Docker can
help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll give an introduction to Docker, an overview of some of the current
tools in the Docker ecosystem (Docker Machine and Docker Compose) and
demonstrate how to create, build, and deploy Python applications using
Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is targeted towards web developers, data scientists, or really
anyone who develops using Python that would like to learn more about
Docker and how it can help their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
