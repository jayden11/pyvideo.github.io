Through experimentation with educational hardware and software, Obelisk Systems has identified the need for, and developed a brand new framework to allow students (both university and high-school) fluid interaction with complex hardware within classrooms. This framework is further implemented into an API that handles all low-level sensor access whilst maintaining relevance to a wide variety of students.
This API will be used to interface with space experimentation and education hardware being developed by Obelisk Systems.&lt;/p&gt;

The talk aims to highlight how Python is the perfect programming language to make programming more fun and immediately applicable to young learners. By making use of standard library modules such as the fractions module, third party packages such as matplotlib and sympy, the audience will learn how to write programs to solve common math problems. Some of the topics that will be discussed are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulating uniform and non-uniform random events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawing Fractals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solving algebraic equations and inequalities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solving calculus problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Graphical User Interface with Python is a tricky business. Come and learn a bit about Kivy and learn about my successes and failures using it with my Senior Software Development students (in NSW) to introduce GUI and App development with Python.
In this workshop you'll be introduced to the Kivy library, the tagging and formatting in kv files, setting up the python classes to support the UI and passing parameters between them.
The workshop is not really suitable for the Python beginner because we need to play around with classes and methods (one of the challenges with using it in the classroom) but will otherwise be a fairly measured pace.&lt;/p&gt;

Python is an ideal first programming language for secondary school students due to the simplicity of its syntax, its enforced code formatting, and the extensibility of the language. Introducing Python to a school however, takes planning, an incremental approach, and modification to existing curriculum plans based on experience. In this presentation, you will be given an overview of how a high school has introduced Python through years 8-12. You will also learn about various Python packages and environments that can be of benefit to a school including: Python Turtle, Grok Learning, Pygame, Flask, and PythonAnywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

Embedded programming allows students to take their programs into the physical world - to build robots and interactive gadgets with sensors and displays. Until recently, this has been almost exclusively the domain of lower level languages like C which is not known for its beginner friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MicroPython is an optimized implementation of Python 3 designed to be run on the sort of embedded microcontrollers that are making their way into the classroom, allowing Python to take the place of C. In particular, the BBC MicroBit, the pyboard and the ESP8266 all now support MicroPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using a language that students are already familiar with, more time can be spent on fun things like building robots and less time debugging code or setting up development tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with teaching embedded programming in a classroom environment is the equipment required - both the actual boards and any additional accessories or modules. We will also demonstrate a browser-based MicroBit simulator which makes embedded programming accessible to more students and also allows for the creation of structured lessons, problems and assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

The development of the Digital Technologies curriculum and the shift from ICT to DT has dramatically changed the teaching of computing in schools. This change has challenged teachers to find new solutions and software to assist them in their teaching of the curriculum. Some schools have employed Python as a way of meeting these challenges and requirements outlined in the curriculum documents.
The band description 8.6 states that  by the end of Grade Eight students should be using a general purpose language to code solutions. At Terrace we decided to use Python to achieve this outcome because of Python’s ease of deployment, cost and syntax light approach. Students in Grade Eight use the turtle and functions to write their name and create shapes. In Grades Nine and Ten the band description states:Students develop modular solutions to complex problems using an object-oriented programming language where appropriate, and evaluate their solutions and existing information systems based on a broad set of criteria including connections to existing policies and their enterprise potential. To achieve this we get students to program classes and databases. Students create a piece of software that creates customers for a bank or a character creator for an RPG. Students design, implement and evaluate the software that they create. In this presentation I will share the successes and failures over the past five years and provide people with software options, programs of work and ideas for Grades Eight to Ten when using Python.&lt;/p&gt;

Schools face a daunting challenge to increase their student
exposure to coding, hands-on technology learning to solve some
real-world problems and teaching STEM principles (Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics) through design, construction and testing.
This personal presentation by a leading teacher illustrate journey to
connect his students to some real-world problems and the challenges
faced along the way. Following on from an earlier
computational-thinking challenge to build and program a moving
vehicle, Roland's current mission is to challenge students to design,
build a smart city consisting of intelligent vehicles and
infrastructure. To do this they need to program a navigation algorithm
to autonomously navigate vehicles through a series of traffic
challenges that test collision avoidance and road safety. They have
been invited to showcase their work at the ITS2016 Word Congress in
Melbourne with a maker-space for delegates to share our hands-on
problem solving and learning with the software and models developed by
the students. Moonshots live in a grey area between audacious
technology and pure science fiction. Our moonshot was to empower
students around the globe to build and control their future.&lt;/p&gt;

With the new national curriculum for Digital Technologies, there is a fantastic opportunity (and in some schools, need) to teach programming in conjunction with other learning areas. Python is an ideal first language, and there is a natural and deep relationship between mathematics and computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the Python’s Turtle module (an implementation of Logo) to create resources that integrate the Year 7 Geometry topic and the basics of Python programming in a way that’s highly engaging for students. Learn about how we integrated the two subject areas and the results of our pilot run with a cohort of Year 7 students in NSW.&lt;/p&gt;

Teaching programming has always been a challenge given the lack of experience, understanding and knowledge students in schools generally have about what is involved and what it means to be studying &amp;quot;IT&amp;quot;. It hasn't been helped by a lack of robust curriculum in most states and territories in Australia. With the recent endorsement of the Australian Curriculum: Digital Technologies, most states and territories have implementation timelines as early as 2017, and this means that teachers (and those who want to support them in their classrooms) now have an obligation to deliver ambitious, engaging and rigorous learning activities in their classrooms. Having been in the enviable situation of being supported and encouraged to design and implement innovative computer science curricula for students in years 6-12, I'll be sharing the reasons why I choose to use Python as my primary teaching language in high school, and identify the tips, tricks and traps teachers need to watch out for when using it as the basis for learning not just programming skills, but computational thinking more generally. This includes an explanation of the importance of a project-driven approach, and demonstration of the techniques I use and projects my students work on in class.&lt;/p&gt;

Minecraft is one of the best selling video games of all time. So, why not use it as a tool for teaching Python?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of clicking to place blocks, students can create giant shapes, structures or even games within the game by learning some basic Python code - and along the way, key programming concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will cover how it works, and what you need to set this up for school or home. We'll look at examples of coding projects, how it can relate to other subjects in the curriculum (such as maths and design), and discuss why this is a great tool for introducing beginners to text-based coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No prior knowledge required, although some familiarity with the Minecraft game and/ or text-based coding will be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended for teachers or parents of students in Years 5 - 12 who are at a beginner or intermediate stage of learning programming.  Budding young coders also welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming is one of the most important 21st-century skills and tons
of different online and offline resources can help you to master it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, playing games is really effective way for us to
learn and it's also the most fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is it possible to learn real programming language like Python by
playing a game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll show you some projects that allow you to achieve
that. I also want to inspire you to help such projects and to suggest
ideas how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming is one of the most important 21st-century skills. It
doesn't only provide promising career opportunities but teaches how to
reason logically, systematically and creatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code readability, rich standard library, straightforward syntax and
other features make Python a great language for teaching beginners how
to program. Python community is very supportive and friendly to
newcomers and does awesome work to make Python available to everyone.
Tons of different online and offline resources can help you to master
Python programming. Problem solving is the classical way of learning
how to code. But it can be boring for some people, especially for
kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, playing games is really effective way for us to
learn and it's also the most fun. You can find different games
designed to teach basics of programming, but most of them use special
visual environments and don't teach real text based languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is it possible to learn programming language like Python by playing a game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll show you a few projects for different age and levels
that allow you to achieve that. I'll pay attention on methods that are
used to teach programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to inspire you to help such projects and to suggest ideas
how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

We discuss the design and implementation of a new biological signal processing course at Harvard, ES155, which fuses Wearable technology and cloud-based analysis of data. ES155 bridges the gap that has traditionally existed between Electrical Engineering and Computer Science education, in a framework that we term “Labs in the Wild”. In the process of designing the course, we have had to solve the problem of serving Jupyter notebooks on the cloud reliably using AWS EC2 instances. This is a challenging problem because a successful approach must be scalable, cost-effective, reliable, and address the privacy concerns associated with cloud-based technologies. We describe our system in this talk, and perform a live demo of how students in our class interact with the system, and give examples of ingenious final projects put together by students. Being cloud-based, our system lowers the barrier of entry for students to begin using Python for scientific computing.&lt;/p&gt;

textbooks, by making class time and individual study more interactive
through the inclusion of executable code and animations. I will demo
some materials and activities I've provided for students using the
IPython notebook. I will focus on practical issues I've faced that are
particular to this teaching approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional university teaching is based on the use of lectures in class
and textbooks out of class. The medium (lecture or book) discourages the
natural curiosity that can lead to deeper understanding by investigating
the result of changing a parameter, or looking at the full results of a
time-dependent simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPython notebook provides a single medium in which mathematics,
explanations, executable code, and animated or interactive visualization
can be combined. Notebooks that combine all of these components can
enable new modes of student-led inquiry: the student can experiment with
modifications to the code and see the results, all without stepping away
from the mathematical explanations themselves. When notebooks are used
by students in the classroom, students can quickly share and discuss
results with the instructor or other class members. The instructor can
facilitate deeper learning by posing questions that students may answer
through writing appropriate code, during class time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past four years, I have taught a graduate numerical analysis
course using SAGE worksheets and IPython notebooks. I will show examples
of the notebooks I've developed and successfully used in this course. I
will describe some practical aspects of my experience, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tradeoffs between using IPython and SAGE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiences with use of cloud computing platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing with students' installation issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quickly getting students up to speed with the Python language and
packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing and evaluating homework in a math course that is
programming-intensive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

course in scientific computing using python for physics majors at Cal
Poly San Luis Obispo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computational tools and skills are as critical to the training of
physics majors as calculus and math, yet they receive much less emphasis
in the undergraduate curriculum. One-off courses that introduce
programming and basic numerical problem-solving techniques with
commercial software packages for topics that appear in the traditional
physics curriculum are insufficient to prepare students for the
computing demands of modern technical careers. Yet tight budgets and
rigid degree requirements constrain the ability to expand computational
course offerings for physics majors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will present an overview of a recently revamped course at Cal
Poly San Luis Obispo that uses Python and associated scientific
computing libraries to introduce the fundamentals of open-source tools,
version control systems, programming, numerical problem solving and
algorithmic thinking to undergraduate physics majors. The spirit of the
course is similar to the bootcamps organized by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://software-carpentry.org"&gt;Software
Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; for researchers in science
but is offered as a ten-week for-credit course. In addition to having a
traditional in-class component, students learn the basics of Python by
completing tutorials on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.codecademy.com"&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;'s
Python track and practice their algorithmic thinking by tackling
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://projecteuler.net"&gt;Project Euler&lt;/a&gt; problems. This approach of
incorporating online training may provide a different way of thinking
about the role of MOOCs in higher education. The early part of the
course focuses on skill-building, while the second half is devoted to
application of these skills to an independent research-level

meteorology curriculum at Millersville University. All students take a
course in Fortran, and many take additional courses in Python and
atmospheric numerical modeling. This presentation discusses how
scientific computing is incorporated into the curriculum, and why
Fortran and Python were chosen as the languages to be taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific computing is integrated into the undergraduate meteorology
curriculum at Millersville University. The curriculum guidelines
published by the American Meteorological Society specifically address
scientific computing in undergraduate atmospheric sciences curricula,
stating that students should gain “experience using a high-level
structured programming language (e.g., C, C++, Python, MATLAB, IDL, or
Fortran).” This is addressed at Millersville via the
programming-specific courses are ESCI 282 – &lt;em&gt;Fortran Programming for the
Earth Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, and ESCI 386 – &lt;em&gt;Scientific Programming, Analysis and
Visualization with Python&lt;/em&gt;. There are also additional courses in which
the students are required to use scientific computing as part of their
assignments. Examples of these courses are ESCI 445 – &lt;em&gt;Numerical
Modeling of the Atmosphere and Oceans&lt;/em&gt;, and ESCI 390 – &lt;em&gt;Remote Sensing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the university’s computer science department teaches
programming courses in Java, this is not very applicable to our
students’ needs for scientific programming. We therefore teach our own
programming courses in-house. The required programming course taken by
all students is the Fortran course, which teaches them the elements of
programming. This is many students’ first exposure to programming. Most
then follow-on by taking the Python course. In the Python course,
scientific data analysis and visualization are stressed, using the
Scientific Python, Numerical Python, and Matplotlib libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the elective numerical modeling course, students are required to
write programs for finite-difference solutions to various 1-D and 2-D
partial differential equations relevant to modeling the fluid dynamics
of the atmosphere. They may program in any language of their choosing,
but the majority of students choose Python, even if they have no prior
experience with it. This is because of Python’s intuitive syntax and
ease of use. In the elective remote sensing course students are
introduced to and use IDL/ENVI for display and analysis of remote
sensing imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 2012 the current Python course was instead taught as a course
in IDL. The transition was made for several reasons. The primary reason
was the limited market and usage of IDL compared to more pervasive
languages such as MATLAB and Python. Many students would not have access
to IDL once they graduate. Also, Python is gaining traction in usage in
the atmospheric and oceanic sciences, and is not proprietary like IDL
and MATLAB, so students will have access to it no matter where they find
employment or graduate school opportunities. The high cost of
maintaining an institutional IDL license is also an issue that the
university must address annually, and it times of lean budgets it
becomes an attractive target for elimination. The IDL course is still on
the books, but there are no immediate plans for upcoming offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

Django which allows students and researchers interested in the modeling
of infectious diseases to learn both modeling and scientific computing
skills in an interactive environment, without forcing theoretical and
computational skills to be developed simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computational and mathematical models can yield profound insights in the
study of the spread of infectious diseases, illustrating difficult
concepts such as herd immunity, suggesting new avenues for empirical
research, and obtaining repeatable, quantifiable evidence in situations
where other study designs are difficult if not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching infectious disease modeling presents a challenge however, as it
requires the development of three unrelated skill sets: the theory of
infectious disease models, subject-matter expertise about the diseases
themselves, and the programming skills needed to implement all but the
simplest models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than forcing these skill sets to be developed in parallel, &lt;em&gt;Zeke&lt;/em&gt;
is an educational platform meant to allow students to develop these
skills in sequence. It uses a zombie epidemic to remove the need for
specific expertise regarding disease systems, relying instead on a
familiar cultural reference. Students are allowed to first explore the
theory of modeling, a Django front-end enabling interaction with models
without the need for scientific computing skills. All the models are
however implemented to be stand-alone models that can be run using SciPy
or other packages, and as students grow in sophistication the
open-source nature of &lt;em&gt;Zeke&lt;/em&gt; allows them to develop both computational
and subject-specific expertise in a stepwise fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The London Python Code Dojo is a community organised monthly meeting for
Python programmers in the UK. Variously described as social coding,
developer training, &amp;quot;Scrapheap Challenge&amp;quot; for Pythonistas and &amp;quot;I didn't
learn coding like this when I was a lad&amp;quot;, we've forked the traditional
code-dojo format and turned it into something very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain and explore what happens in the dojo, how it's
organised and why various changes were made to the classic dojo format.
Reference will also be made to influences from music education and
philosophy of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, by the end of the talk you'll all want to go organise a dojo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Brendan McCane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In first semester 2009, CS at Otago introduced an introductory
programming course using Python. This talk will describe the course and
student outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover the following topics: - the problems of teaching and
learning programming - does language make a difference? - why Python is
a good choice for a first language - the structure of the course -
things that worked well, and things that didn't - what students thought
about it - impact on learning Java in the second semester - changes for
2010 Note: this is a preliminary outline, it's likely that it will
change somewhat before the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]&lt;/p&gt;
