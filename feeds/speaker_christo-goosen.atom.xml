implementation of Python 3 on microcontrollers. The project is
summarized in the following statement: &amp;quot;MicroPython is a lean and
efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that
includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised
to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments&amp;quot;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://micropython.org/"&gt;http://micropython.org/&lt;/a&gt;). With IOT gaining more momentum daily and
devices such as the ESP8266 (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13678"&gt;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13678&lt;/a&gt;)
now able to serve web pages, MicroPython is a viable candidate for fast
prototyping and simple embedded devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus mainly on the ESP8266 &amp;amp; Unix implementation of
MicroPython. The ESP8266 is an amazing device, considering it is the
size of a R5 coin and can run an implementation of Python. The talk will
cover features, limitations and some simple ideas to get going. A demo
of a simple Home Automation/IOT application with MicroPython &amp;amp; the
ESP8266 will also be included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to bring the familiarity of Python 3 to developers, with
the hope of encouraging hack-a-day type projects without extensive
embedded device knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
