needs to be reused. Then you think, I can do this with subclassing! Now
you have a diamond-tree of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we’ll talk about a better way of code reuse and introducing
alternate behaviour into existing classes — composition. It’ll improve
how you test your code — making your test runs faster, making it easier
to test exceptional cases, and making everything easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

request-response cycle — a request comes in, a response is generated,
and that is delivered to the client. In the day of “single page”
applications, where only sections of the page are updated through
requests, doing real-time can be clunky. Twisted, and things that build
off it, like Django Channels, might be worth thinking about, and this is
what this talk will be about.&lt;/p&gt;
