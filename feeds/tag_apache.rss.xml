We'll then setup a Django app and
deploy it to a VM. I'll cover server setup/config and best practices and
cover software used like Fabric, nginx etc. Sample nginx, WSGI and
Apache configs will be provided. People can follow along and I'll
provide download links after so they can try it at home. This will be
the best meeting ever.&lt;/p&gt;

Apache mod_wsgi PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the config you want to use if you don't know what you want to
use. You don't need to make any choices, you don't have to do any
research, and you don't even need to read the docs if you don't want to.
And as an added bonus, I show how to wget a vm image to deploy into with
network ports exposed. It is very much like working with a hosting
provider like Slice Host, and it makes a great framework for testing
server installs.&lt;/p&gt;
