&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will give many examples of when Bayes rule will help you in your day to day work. I'll quickly show many examples of bayesian statistical thinking in action; the pleasure of inference, probabilistic graphs, model selection, feature generation, even operations research! I'll finish with a dataset from Heroes of the Storm and I'll show why Bayesian models can outperform randomforests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk is made up of the following examples;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;basic disease example: what is the value of adding an extra test to a patient
give an example of an inference task that is very hard to do properly without bayesian thinking
creating simple probibalistic models with pandas and showing how they are robust against missing data. I will also demo pomegranate, a new probabilistic programming tool for python.
show how you can use bayes rule to pick models
demo a bayesian probablistic approach to finding overpowered characters in the Heroes of the Storm video game.&lt;/p&gt;

[EuroPython 2015]
[21 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will describe how to use Apache Spark (PySpark) with
some data from the World of Warcraft API from an iPython notebook.
Spark is interesting because it speeds up iterative processes on your
hadoop cluster as well as your local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will give basic benchmarks (comparing it to numpy/pandas/scikit),
explain the architecture/performance behind the technology and will
give a live demo on how I used Spark to analyse an interesting
dataset. I'll explain why you might want to use Spark and I'll also go
in and explain when you don't want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset I will be using is a 22Gb json blob containing auction
house data from all world of warcraft servers over a period of time.
The goal of the analysis will be to determine when and if basic
economics still applies in a massively online game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will assume that the everyone knows what the ipython notebook is and
I will assume a basic knowledge of numpy/pandas but nothing fancy. The
dataset has been chosen such that people who are less interested in
Spark can still enjoy the analysis part of the talk. If you know very
little about data science but if you love video games then you should
like this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

[EuroPython 2016]
[19 July 2016]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/the-joy-of-simulation-for-fun-and-profit"&gt;https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/the-joy-of-simulation-for-fun-and-profit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk discusses some joyful exercises in simulation. I'll
demonstrate it's usefulness but moreover I'll discuss the sheer joy.
I'll discuss how to generate song lyrics, I'll discuss how to get
better at casino games, how to avoid math, how to play monopoly or
even how to invest in lego minifigures. No maths required; just a
random number generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk discusses some joyful exercises in simulation. I'll
demonstrate it's usefulness but moreover I'll discuss the sheer joy
you can experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll go over the following points (the short list):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll show how you can avoid math by simulating; I'll calculate the probability that two people in the live room have the same birthday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll show how simulation can help you get better at many games. I'll start with simple card games and with the game of roulette. Most prominently I'll discuss how to determine the value of buying an asset in the game of monopoly (See blogpost: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://koaning.io/monopoly-simulations.html"&gt;http://koaning.io/monopoly-simulations.html&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll demonstrate how you can simulate Red Hot Chilli Pepper lyrics. Or any other band. Or legalese.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll demonstrate the results of a scraping exercise which helped me to determine the value of investing in Lego Minifigures (See blogpost: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://koaning.io/lego-minifigs-stochastics-profit.html"&gt;http://koaning.io/lego-minifigs-stochastics-profit.html&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the level of the audience I might also discuss how biased
simulation can help you solve optimisation problems or even introduce
bayesian statistics via sampling. I'll gladly leave this decision to
the EuroPython committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This talk is about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning the basics of pandas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning the basics of visualisation with ggplot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combining the two&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the talk will be slides, the other part will be done via an
iPython-notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
