writing debuggers. Spreadsheets are used more than any other statistical
tool, but version control still can't handle them. Everyone thinks we
should teach kids to program, but courses on computing education are
almost nonexistent. This talk explores why these gaps exist and what
they tell us about computing today and in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Wilson is the co-founder of Software Carpentry, a volunteer
organization that teaches basic computing skills to researchers in a
wide range of disciplines. He has worked for 30 years in both industry
and academia, and is the author or editor of several books on computing
(including the 2008 Jolt Award winner &amp;quot;Beautiful Code&amp;quot;) and two for
children. Greg received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University

Do different people really have different learning styles? Do flipped classrooms actually work better than regular lectures? This tutorial will explore recent research in these areas and more, and show participants how to apply that research in the classroom to improve teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
