&lt;p&gt;We have ethical responsibilities when coding. We’re able to extract
remarkably precise intuitions about an individual. But do we have a
right to know what they didn’t consent to share, even when they
willingly shared the data that leads us there? A major retailer’s
data-driven marketing accidentially revealed to a teen’s family that she
was pregnant. Eek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are our obligations to people who did not expect themselves to be
so intimately known without sharing directly? How do we mitigate against
unintended outcomes? For instance, an activity tracker carelessly
revealed users’ sexual activity data to search engines. A social
network’s algorithm accidentally triggered painful memories for grieving
families who’d recently experienced death of their child and other loved
ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We design software for humans. Balancing human needs and business specs
can be tough. It’s crucial that we learn how to build in systematic
empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll delve into specific examples of uncritical
programming, and painful results from using insightful data in ways that
were benignly intended. You’ll learn ways we can integrate practices for
examining how our code might harm individuals. We’ll look at how to flip
the paradigm, netting consequences that can be better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

Users are giving push-back to ill-fitted assumptions about their own
identity — name, gender, sexual orientation, important relationships,
and many other attributes that are individually meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we balance users’ realities with an app’s business requirements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, Google+, and others are struggling with these questions.
Resilient approaches arise from an app’s own foundation. Discover how
our earliest choices influence codebase, UX, and development itself.
Learn how we can use that knowledge to both inspire the people who use
our apps, and to generate the data that need as developers.&lt;/p&gt;
