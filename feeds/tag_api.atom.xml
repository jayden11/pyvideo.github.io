&lt;p&gt;Presented by Issac Kelly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issac is an avid API consumer. He&amp;amp;aposll cover how to make an API that
is not terrible. This is apparently very difficult to do, and many
anti-patterns will be shown. No care will be taken to protect the
guilty. This talk is not as focused on Python, as it is on creating Web
APIs, and an understanding of HTTP is assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

applications from the community. I will highlight some of the best
applications that the Django/Python community has put together, talk
about places that are lacking, and talk about what these popular
applications have in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written a series of blog posts about &amp;quot;Large problems&amp;quot; in the
community, and how they have been solved by members of our community
with reusable apps. Previously I have covered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delayed Execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database Migrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will update my thoughts on these issues, as well as talking about a
couple of other new issues that I think that have been solved in a
decent way. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote Command Execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging in Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous Integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this part I will highlight issues that are still headaches for the
Community. These are places where there is a good chance for growth for
third party apps, and places where I have personally found some friction
in my development. A couple examples of this are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class Based Views / Thread Safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging Production Environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above applications that are well done, what makes a popular
reusable app? This won't be my thoughts, but more looking at apps that
have been successful and trying to see what they have in common. A good
app and a good reusable app are necessarily different, and I think it
will be interesting to look at what traits make reusable apps popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Tareque Hossain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years RESTful APIs have become an integral part of
many django projects. But some of the fundamental questions still remain
unanswered. How do you decouple resources from models, formatting from
definitions, authorization from authentication? How should you define
resources? How do you handle pagination? Deliver facets? Prevent abuse?
Implement versioning? Let's have a look.&lt;/p&gt;

programmatic (non-web-based) APIs for use by other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're a developer of any sort (Django, Python, Javascript, etc),
chances are that someone, at some point, will have to take the code
you've written &amp;amp; use it in a different context. This is even more
amplified if you work on OSS, where people &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; use it in ways you've
never dreamed about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is a reflection on my experience building libraries for other
people's consumption &amp;amp; thoughts on how to design/make (non-HTTP) APIs in
a way that will make others love you (or at least not hunt you down &amp;amp;
strangle you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLDB is an open source compiler currently under development. LLDB
incorporates Python in several different ways: From the command line,
one can drop into an interactive Python script interpreter, entering
normal Python interactive commands and having them interpreted and
executed. In addition, the LLDB debugger has a programming API that
allows users to call actual debugger functions and access real debugger
objects. This API is run through SWIG and converted into a Python module
that gets automatically imported into the interactive interpreter inside
LLDB. The upshot of this is that, in the Python mode, users can call the
API functions as if they were regular Python functions. This is turn
means that users can do things like hit a breakpoint, call the
appropriate API functions to get the actual current frame object, check
to see if the caller function several frames up the stack is a
particular function, and if so, perform some other interesting action.
LLDB also allows for breakpoint commands to be written in Python (which
therefore allows them to call the API functions), as well as having a
command that interprets and executes a single line of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the API and all of the debugger functionality is available in a
Python module, it is also possible to write a debugger front end
completely in Python and have it import the LLDB module and call the
LLDB API functions (which calls into the LLDB shared library), to create
a new debugger front end. Our test suite takes advantage of this to run
tests on the LLDB library without having to start up an interactive LLDB
debubgger session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many interesting problems encountered and overcome in getting
all of this to work. LLDB combines both interactive Python and embedded
Python. There were some interesting things worked out so that a single
Python environment dictionary is used for the entire debugger session: A
user can pop into and out of the interactive interpreter and have access
at any time to anything defined in any previous visit to the interactive
interpreter (within the same debug session); breakpoint commands have
access to everything defined in the interactive session; so do embedded
script commands. It gets even more complicated, because LLDB can have
multiple debugger sessions alive at once, and each debugger session has
its own Python interpreter with its own dictionary and must not be
allowed to interfere with another session's state. In this talk I will
discuss how we implemented many of these features in LLDB, pointing out
some of the more interesting problems we encountered and how we overcame
them, and demonstrate it all working in LLDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designing interfaces so that other code can interact with ours (whether
our code is a library, framework, application, website…) is a very
common and clearly crucial activity, but it's fraught with dangers -
there's a lot stuff we all keep doing wrong time after time. This talk
shows some common categories of API design errors encountered in the
wild, with tips on how to avoid them when you design your next API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals: to show you how to focus resources and attention to help avoid
mistakes in API design. Prereqs: experience designing and developing
software, esp. software which needs to interact w/other existing
software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was my motivation for working with Python after two years of PHP?
There is so much you can do. Functions are objects you can pass around,
you can decompile functions to see how they work internally, you can
alias a bound method to a global function and it will just work. You can
change import semantics, override the method resolution order, you can
write metaclasses, you can hook into the CPython interpreter API and
much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years later I came to the conclusion that this is really not what
Python is about and that a lot of what I did was interesting but not
necessarily a good idea. This talk is a 45 minute recompilation of
things I really shouldn't have done in the first place. Expect a bunch
of neat and interesting hacks that showcase the possibilities of the
language.&lt;/p&gt;

informazioni relative alle strutture dati da usare per comunicare con
dispositivi e/o programmi software. Tali informazioni sono memorizzate
in un modello UML, generato interfacciandosi con il CASE tool usato in
azienda (Rational Rose). - Utilizza i dati in un modello UML - di solito
una versione migliorata a mano di quello generato automaticamente - per
generare un set di classi C++, una per messaggio, che forniscono i
metodi per serializzare/deserializzare i messaggi usando le API
specifiche del progetto. Il programma è stato scritto in Python 2.x ed
utilizza i seguenti moduli esterni: - pywin32: per interfacciare sia MS
Word che il tool CASE usando lo standard COM. - ply : per analizzare il
file in cui il tool CASE memorizza il modello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;plac is general purpose tool than can be used to define command-oriented
domain specific languages (DSLs). In its simplest form it can be used as
a command-line arguments parser with an easier-to-use API than argparse.
It can also be used to replace the cmd module in the standard library.
Moreover it can be used to automatize functional tests and for much
more. The talk will touch upon many use cases where plac can make your
life as a developer simpler and better. Technically Plac is a wrapper
over argparse and works in all versions of Python starting from Python
2.3 up to Python 3.2. In Python 3.X it takes advantage of function
annotations to define the parser in a declarative way, instead of the
imperative way of argparse. In Python 2.X it uses decorators instead, to
reach the same goal. The talk is a hands-on interactive demonstration of
plac capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadoop is the leading open source implementation of MapReduce, Google's
large scale distributed computing paradigm. Hadoop's native API is in
Java, and its built-in options for Python programming - Streaming and
Jython - have several drawbacks: the former allows to access only a
small subset of Hadoop's features, while the latter carries with it all
of the limitations of Jython with respect to CPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pydoop.sourceforge.net"&gt;Pydoop&lt;/a&gt; is an API for Hadoop that
makes most of its features available to Python programmers while
allowing CPython development. Its core consists of Boost.Python wrappers
for Hadoop's C/C++ interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk consists of a MapReduce/Hadoop tutorial and a presentation of
the Pydoop API, with the main goal of bridging the gap between the
Hadoop and Python communities. A basic knowledge of distributed
programming is helpful but not strictly required.&lt;/p&gt;

mobile device. We’ll talk about why we chose Django and the TastyPie API
package, and discuss other Python-based frameworks that could be used to
build the API such as Pyramid, Flask and Bottle. We’ll also compare REST
and custom APIs to understand best practices for building APIs designed
for mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building scrapers for grabbing data from websites. Tools, techniques,
and tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life would be so much easier if the data contained in websites was
available raw via APIs. Alas, until that mythical day comes we either
need to deal with unhelpful people via email and phone, or just get it
ourselves. Python has some great tools available to help with building
scrapers and for parsing and formatting the data we get. Starting off
with the basics - tracking what needs to be done, making web requests,
parsing HTML, following links, and extricating data from Excel and PDF
documents. Our scraper needs to be resilient against too-clever content
management systems, Frontpage-era HTML, and plain dodgy data. We may
need to pass through logins and other messiness. There are some
techniques and tips for approaching the problems and keeping your
solution flexible and as simple as possible. We'll discuss some scrapers
built for New Zealand data, and introduce a new project from the NZ open
government data group to provide a RESTful interface to scrapers -
effectively creating a nice API where there isn't one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Ivan Beschastnikh, Justin Samuel, and Justin Cappos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seattle is an open-source platform for developing and deploying
networked applications. Core feature of Seattle is that it allows safe
execution of untrusted code on end-user systems. In our talk we look at
how we used Python to build a safe, restricted code execution
environment for Seattle that not only provides execution safety but also
enforces strict resource consumption limits. In addition, Seattle
includes a high-level API to hide inconsistent OS-specific behaviors
from developers. What results is a platform that welcomes the
participation of end-user machines for general-purpose distributed
programming and creates new possibilities for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Alex Martelli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing interfaces so that other code can interact with ours (whether
our code is a library, framework, application, website...) is a very
common and clearly crucial activity, but fraught with dangers -- stuff
we all keep doing wrong time after time. This talks shows some common
cases of API design errors encountered in the wild, with tips on how to
avoid them when you design your next API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we write code we should always be thinking about how other code
(whether our own, or other people's) will interact with ours (an &amp;quot;API&amp;quot;,
in common parlance). Indeed, the most common and terrible mistake in API
design is... not doing any! -- i.e., not providing any designed,
architected way for other code to interact with ours. That's fortunately
less common when &amp;quot;our code&amp;quot; is a library or framework;-), but, alas!,
sadly widespread when &amp;quot;our code&amp;quot; is an application or website -- that's
why questions about screen- scraping the web and simulating keystrokes
and mouse gestures need be so tragically frequent all over the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once past the obvious hurdle of not having any API at all, there's still
plenty of ways we can go badly wrong in the process of designing one --
and many of those ways fall into recognizable categories, i.e.,
patterns. Specifically, since they're frequently observed categories of
defective design, they're anti-patterns -- and that's what this talk is
in fact about (as the smartest among you could tell from the title...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm eminently qualified to present on this subject, since, in a lifetime
spent mostly stumbling into software (after actually qualifying to
design hardware in college, but only doing that for a few years), I've
been responsible for more of my shares of API design fumbles (plus, of
course, just like every other programmer, I've done my share of swearing
at the design fumbles of other API designers). And, as novelist Richard
Bach reminds us, &amp;quot;You teach best what you most need to learn&amp;quot;!-)&lt;/p&gt;
