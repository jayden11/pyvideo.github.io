&lt;p&gt;Volunteers often love running introductory programming workshops. This talk covers how to help attendees get the most out of your volunteer time. We’ll look at how to make a tutorial easier for attendees to follow and tips that help students stay relaxed and learn effectively. The talk incorporates what I learned as a student teacher and includes a new source of help in revising newcomer material.&lt;/p&gt;
