constant increase of MRI sequences, neuroimaging datasets are growing
constantly. Nowadays a Neurological research study has to be considered
a big data problem. In this talk I will introduce from scratch some of
the most common algorithms for computing neuroimaging biomarkers and
give some ideas about efficiency increasing. Some examples in python
will be given.&lt;/p&gt;
