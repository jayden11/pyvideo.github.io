Several exciting trends are driving the birth of the intelligent cloud. The vast majority of world’s data is now connected data resident in the cloud. The majority of world’s new software is now connected software, also resident in or using the cloud. New cloud based Machine Learning as a Service platforms help transform data into intelligence and build cloud-hosted intelligent APIs for connected software applications. Face analysis, computer vision, text analysis, speech recognition, and more traditional analytics such as churn prediction, recommendations, anomaly detection, forecasting, and clustering are all available now as cloud APIs, and far more are being created at a rapid pace. Cloud hosted marketplaces for crowdsourcing intelligent APIs have been launched. In this talk I will review what these trends mean for the future of data science and show examples of revolutionary applications that you can build using cloud platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
