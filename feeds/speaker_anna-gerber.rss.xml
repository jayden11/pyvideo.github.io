interactive systems such as robots that sense and act upon, or respond
to the physical world — provides an ideal application space for teaching
and learning programming concepts and problem solving; that appeals to a
diverse audience; and that can provide a positive introduction to the
world of open source software and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on her experiences teaching introductory programming with
Arduino-based robots, Anna will step through a tutorial demonstrating
how to develop a mobile PyBot - a robot programmed using Python and the
Firmata protocol, and will provide tips to help you or the apprentice
coders in your life to take the first steps towards a lifetime of loving
to code.&lt;/p&gt;
