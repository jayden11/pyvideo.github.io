imaginable, but letting application teams choose storage engines
independently can lead to duplicated efforts and wheel reinvention. This
talk will explore how to build a reusable data pipeline based on Kafka
to support multiple applications, datasets, and use cases including
archival, warehousing and analytics, stream and batch processing, and
low-latency &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; storage.&lt;/p&gt;

Almost every software project of meaningful scale eventually runs into architectural problems. One of the larger issues we’ve dealt with at Twilio is an increasingly-brittle and hard-to-manage PHP codebase, originally responsible for running a website and public REST API. Rather than risk a from-scratch rewrite of the entire system, we chose to extract small and well-defined chunks one at a time into simple services using a common internal interface standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a new fleet of services and a set of internal REST APIs, how do we get to parity with the existing public API specifications? Rather than force every service to implement authentication, data validation, rate-limiting, and so on, we chose to build a simple federation service to translate and proxy customer requests to internal systems. Python was a natural choice for this application due to its flexibility, extensive library and testing ecosystem, and suitability for rapid prototyping and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But: how did we get from A to B? This talk will cover the details of Twilio’s past and current API architecture, how we adapted the service-oriented architecture pattern to build a consistent public interface, and the testing and deployment strategies we used to migrate 5 billion monthly requests from old to new systems with no downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the larger issues we’ve dealt with at Twilio is an increasingly-brittle and hard-to-manage PHP codebase, originally responsible for running a website and public REST API. Over time, core business logic has been extracted from the legacy codebase into internal services fronted by a public REST API. This talk will explore how Python and Flask were used to build a simple proxying HTTP layer to handle all of Twilio’s API traffic and direct it to the appropriate internal systems. Along the way, we’ll cover why Python is well-suited to this application, ways to test code that’s replacing existing services, deployment strategies, and all of the benefits that came from migrating to more modern systems.&lt;/p&gt;

Complete rewrites are expensive and prone to failure, so how &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; one go about replacing that large, crufty codebase with something easier to maintain? We’ll discuss the strategies used at Twilio to migrate a large REST API, piece by piece, out of a monolithic PHP system into a fleet of services federated by a Python proxy layer.&lt;/p&gt;
