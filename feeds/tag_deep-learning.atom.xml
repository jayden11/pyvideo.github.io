&lt;p&gt;Python as a language for DeepLearning. Python is emerging as the facto language to specify Deep Learning Networks. In this talk we will explore some of the popular libraries like Tensorflow and Keras to see the semantics used to describe such networks and look a bit more under the hood at what is the python layer actually doing for these well known deep learning libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grid search over hyperparameters is an important but computationally expensive process in machine learning, particularly for deep learning and tree ensembles. In this talk, I will describe how one can use joblib's recently added custom backend functionality to do distributed grid search on Amazon EC2 for a TensorFlow deep text classifier that follows the scikit-learn estimator API.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Deep Neural Networks are fast becoming the face of modern Machine Learning. But understanding how they work can be a real challenge, especially while you are trying to build a model. Google's recently published library, TensorFlow, includes a lesser-used utility called TensorBoard that can be used to visualize the structure of your neural network model and inspect how data flows through it. This talk will demonstrate some techniques which will help you use TensorBoard more effectively, and better understand how TensorFlow computations work. Code walkthroughs will be done in iPython notebooks, which will be made available to attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;
Arpan likes to find computing solutions to everyday problems. He is interested in human-computer interaction, robotics and cognitive science. He obtained his PhD from North Carolina State University, focusing on biologically-inspired computer vision. ​Working at Udacity, he develops content for artificial intelligence and machine learning courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python has lots of scientific, data analysis, and machine learning libraries. But there are many problems. Which do you use? How do they compare to each other? How can you use a model that has been trained in your production application?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TensorFlow is a new Open Source framework created at Google for building Deep Learning applications. Tensorflow allows you to construct easy to understand data flow graphs which form a mathematical and logical pipeline. Creating data flow graphs allow easier visualization of complicated algorithms as well as running the training operations over multiple hardware GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensorflow data flow graphs and operations are written in Python. In this talk I will discuss how you can use TensorFlow to create Deep Learning applications.

&lt;p&gt;Description :
&amp;quot;Neural networks&amp;quot; is the name of a machine learning technique that takes inspiration from biological brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Deep learning&amp;quot; is a term used to describe various 'deep' (many layered) networks that are capable of more sophisticated processing than the classic three-layer perceptrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in deep learning, especially the use of convolutional networks and the use of GPUs to process them instead of CPUs, have led to breakthroughs in performance on machine vision, natural language processing, and other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various frameworks have been introduced that facilitate easy experimentation with deep learning networks, amongst others, there are examples such as: Caffe, Theano, and recently Google's Tensorflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keras is a Python framework that uses Theano or Tensorflow as a backend.  It makes the building and testing of such networks much easier, as this session will demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will explain the concepts involved and go through some examples that will enable an intermediate-level python programmer to develop, train and validate their own deep learning networks to perform visual recognition tasks using deep convolutional networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will describe how to plan the basic network topology and will also highlight some common pitfalls and steps that can be taken to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: It will not explain how to set up a machine for these tasks, which is a job in itself. Nor will it explain detailed aspects of neural networks such as specifics of activation functions, optimizers or back propagation. There is just not enough time in the session. I will try to provide some useful links instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep learning: how it works, how to train a deep neural network, the
theory behind deep learning, recent developments and applications.
(length: 60 mins)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(length: 60 mins)    In the last few years, deep neural networks have
been used to generate state of the art results in image
classification, segmentation and object detection. They have also
successfully been used for speech recognition and textual analysis. In
this talk, I will give an introduction to deep neural networks. I will
cover how they work, how they are trained, and a little bit on how to
get going. I will briefly discuss some of the recent exciting and
amusing applications of deep learning. The talk will primarily focus
on image processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you completely new to deep learning, please attend T. Rashid's talk
'A Gentle Introduction to Neural Networks (with Python)'. His talk is
in the same room immediately before mine and his material is really
good and will give you a good grounding in what I will present to you.
:)
You may also want to attend I' Lewis' talk 'Deep Learning with Python
&amp;amp; TensorFlow' after Lunch in the PyCharm room to round it all off! :)&lt;/p&gt;
