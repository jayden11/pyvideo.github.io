&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is an innovative open source project written in Python, backed
by Rackspace Hosting and NASA, building a massively-scalable and
reliable cloud computing platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of this talk will clarify the place of OpenStack in the
general &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot; landscape and explain why a fully open cloud
infrastructure stack is necessary to avoid vendor lock-in. We'll then
focus on the OpenStack project goals, its developer community, its open
design and release processes, and the developer tools it chose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the talk will present into more technical details the
different components of OpenStack: Nova (compute) and Swift (storage),
including the Python libraries that are used (libvirt, SQLAlchemy,
eventlet…). A Q&amp;amp;A session at the end of the talk will give the audience
a chance to clear any remaining dark area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google App Engine is a unique hosting platform that lets you build
applications and run them in Google's data centers using the massive
global infrastructure built to run the Internet's most powerful company.
App Engine offers a development environment that uses familiar
technologies (Java and Python) and provides a powerful and robust set of
APIs to users while maintaining security and independence from other
apps running in the cloud. It is always free to get started so you can
try it out with no risk, and if you need additional computing resources,
you can purchase additional computing resources beyond the free quota
limits. (If you enable billing and trust us with your credit card, we
will extend your free quotas even further; you won't get charged until
you exceed those &lt;em&gt;extended&lt;/em&gt; quotas.) Scale your application to millions
of users and pay only for what you use at competitive market pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we provide an update of the newest features found in
the most recent releases of the App Engine platform. We also share some
suggestions for best practices to existing App Engine developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginners to the App Engine platform will be interested in the
introductory workshop which may be offered (see description below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google App Engine workshop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we'll give you a comprehensive introduction to the
platform in two/three components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-hour Introduction to Cloud computing and Google App Engine seminar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-hour App Engine hands-on workshop/codelab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first hour, we review Cloud Computing as an industry and where
Google App Engine fits into the picture. Specifically, we discuss App
Engine as a PaaS solution because of the inherent challenges of building
web and other applications. We'll outline the architecture of App
Engine, what it's major components are, introduce its features and APIs,
discuss the service and how it works (including information on the free
quotas), present some information about current users and usage,
including integration with Google Apps, and finally, give an overview of
its enterprise edition called Google App Engine for Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the approximately one-hour lecture, we'll show you how to create
applications that run on App Engine by building a simple but real web
application from the ground up via a hands-on coding laboratory.
Although based on the online tutorial, this codelab goes up and beyond
what's in the documentation: you will get a more detailed step-by-step
instructions to replicate that example as well as have the opportunity
to extend your application with some of the newer APIs that come with
App Engine. The codelab will cover the Users service, non-relational
Datastore, and Memcache APIs. Time-permitting, we'll also discuss some
of the newest features found in recent App Engine releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celery is an open source task queueing system based on distributed
message passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will talk about the tools that Celery offers for task distribution and
how to monitor and manage the system using a Django web interface. This
talk will also focus on how we use Celery at Jamendo and our real
solutions to some common issues you may encounter when developing a
back-office based on Celery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brief overview of Celery and the AMPQ protocol AMPQ protocol
overview, Celery introduction: Celery, RabbitMQ code examples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The impact of Celery on the Jamendo work-flow; examples with real
tasks. Here I will talk about the Jamendo back-office infrastructure
and some of our common tasks. I will discuss the improvements made by
introducing a new back-office system based on Celery. I will show
some code snippets and go over some real scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overview of the Django Celery admin interface and some Jamendo
extensions. Let's talk about the Django-Celery interface that allows
one to monitor or schedule tasks directly from the Django admin. I
will explain which common additional features are necessary and how
to add them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common &amp;quot;gotchas&amp;quot; we encountered while working with Celery and how we
solved them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global task locks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centralized logging: be able to read all the logs of all celery
workers on different servers and filter them for real-time debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At ep.io we built a Python hosting platform from the ground up, designed
to run large numbers of web applications on a small number of physical
machines both securely and in a reasonably scalable way. This talk will
show you how we built our infrastructure - using Redis, eventlet,
PostgreSQL and more - and what lessons we learnt from our first few
thousand deploys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how we split services into multiple processes and greenthreads; the
pains of building a cooperatively-multitasking PTY module; how Redis
isn't the answer to everything, but is still very useful; how to
persuade third-party software to work securely in a shared environment;
and how important it is to have good logging, especially when you have
more than five servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Whether you’re an independent developer or development manager
in a large company, “the cloud” is on everyone’s mind. But just because
it’s in the cloud, doesn’t mean development and deployment is
effortless. The cloud presents infrastructure and development challenges
in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, ActiveState's Gisle Aas will share best practices
in building and deploying a Python-centric LAMP stack(s) on the cloud
for a range of web-based applications from simple Django site to HPC GPU
Clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on ActiveState’s experiences, Gisle will discuss the challenges
faced and lessons learned in building an infrastructure to deploy web
applications to the cloud with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which packages are critical for a secure, Python-centric LAMP stack
(and what it takes to build them)!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tips for developing, deploying, and scaling Python applicaitons in
the cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use Python to connect and build infrastructure to support and
manage your deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will show the tools and the infrastructure that makes easy creating
own python project in Ubuntu and distributing it to millions of users.
It will be shown several tools: Launchpad, Quickly and and the Ubuntu's
PPA (personal package archiving).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Roy Hyunjin Han (InvisibleRoads)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whirlwind tour of the roles of different Python modules in the
architecture of a geospatial infrastructure planning system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used Python to transform an elaborate, multistep process for finding
and connecting households in villages into a single, streamlined
planning experience. I'll explain how Python's freely available
libraries empowered a small team of developers under a minimal budget
and timeframe. Now just imagine if we had to do the same thing with
Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Donovan Preston&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the dawn of concurrency research, there have been two camps:
shared everything, and shared nothing. Most modern applications use
threads for concurrency, a shared everything architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actors, however, use a shared nothing architecture where lightweight
processes communicate with each other using message passing. Actors can
change their state, create a new Actor, send a message to any Actor it
has the Address of, and wait for a specific kind of message to arrive in
it's mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss the benefits of using the Actor architecture and
strategies for implementing an Actor system in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
