get dismissed as being too complicated to understand and implement. This
talk breaks down the neural net structure as simply as possible, so you
have a framework on which to grow your knowledge in the space. I will
put neural nets in the context of real-world applications and share
Python packages and code where you can get started building your own.
Coming out this talk you won't know everything about neural nets, but
you will walk away with a solid foundation and some resources on where
to go next to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
