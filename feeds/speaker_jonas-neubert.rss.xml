greatest&lt;/em&gt;: The machines that make smartphones have a serial port and are
configured with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.csv&lt;/tt&gt; files. But when your factory automates complex
non-linear workflows and is jam-packed with sensors and robots, you are
quickly faced with software engineering challenges that call for modern
tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python turns out to be surprisingly versatile in this setting, whether
for prototyping a single conveyor belt or taming a building full of
robots. This talk explains how to use Python for interfacing with two
common industrial automation devices: a barcode scanner and a
Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). After a simple demo, you’ll hear
about lessons learned using Python packages that weren’t written with
robots in mind, like Celery and pandas, with robots.&lt;/p&gt;
