We have a wide variety of packages and modules in Python that help build
commandline tools in different ways. One of the more recent contenders is
'click'. It uses a very intuitive approach to create simple CLIs as well as
complex ones. In this talk, I will introduce building CLIs with 'click' and
illustrate some of its advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Django is a comprehensive web framework that provides well-defined
concepts such as request, response, middleware and view that make our
lives as perfectionists with deadlines much easier. What many of us are
not aware of is the rich collection of utilities and tooling around
these concepts that are part of the famework. Decorators, helper
functions and context managers that are used internally but can make
life as a developer much easier as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction (~ 2 mins)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit about me. Why am I talking about this? Django's Hidden
Treasures (~ 4 mins)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this talks. What do I consider hidden treasures? Which
Django modules are interesting? Are they documented and were do I find
it? Examples of hidden treasures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick introduction of the module. What's a possible use case for it?
How does it solve it? Where is it used in the Django?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cached_property (~ 2 mins)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;import_string (~ 2 mins)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lazy, LazyObject and lazy_property (~ 3 mins)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decorators module (~ 4 mins)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;classonlymethod decorator_from_middleware update_wrapper and wraps
(technically not Django) django.views (~ 4 mins)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;debug.cleanse_setting decorators.debug.sensitive_parameters
decorators.debug.sensitive_post_parameteÂ­rs Wrapping up (~ 2 mins)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django documentation links. Some suggestions for further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

are already using it for their production systems. Although it makes a
lot of things much simpler, it's not a silver bullet and comes with some
caveats of it's own. This talk will describe the journey of my team at
Mobify from a self-hosted VM to a AWS-backed web app deployed using
Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
