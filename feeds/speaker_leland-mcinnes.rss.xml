&lt;p&gt;Finding clusters is a powerful tool for understanding and exploring data. While the task sounds easy, it can be surprisingly difficult to do it well. Most standard clustering algorithms can, and do, provide very poor clustering results in many cases. We discuss how to do clustering correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding clusters is a powerful tool for understanding and exploring data. While the task sounds easy, it can be surprisingly difficult to it well. Most standard clustering algorithms can, and do, provide very poor clustering results in many cases. Our intuitions for what a cluster is are not as clear as we would like, and can easily be lead astray. We will attempt to find a definition of clustering that makes sense for most cases, and introduce an algorithm for finding such clusters, along with a high performance python implementation of the algorithm, building up more intuition for what clustering really means as we go.&lt;/p&gt;

It can be particularly useful in exploratory data analysis for helping to summarize and give intuition about a dataset. Despite it's power clustering is used for this task far less frequently than it could be. A plethora of options for clustering algorithms exist, and we will provide a survey of some of the more popular options, discussing their strengths and weaknesses, particularly with regard to exploratory data analysis. Our focus, however, is on a relatively new algorithm that appears to be the best equipped to meet the needs of exploratory data analysis: HDBSCAN* has the strengths of density based algorithms, has a small robust set of parameters, and with suitable implementation can be made highly scalable to large datasets. We will discuss how the algorithm works, taking a few different perspectives, and explain the techniques used for a high performance implementation. Finally we'll discuss ways to extend the algorithm, drawing on ideas from topological data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
