it, anyway? And more importantly: as a Python user, why should you care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk's goal is twofold: first, to try and demystify the basic idea
of &amp;quot;GIS&amp;quot; for people who are interested in the topic and are coming from
a Python background. I'll cover general GIS concepts, talk about spatial
data, and what makes it unique. Second, to show how you might be able to
use and integrate GIS into your work. I'll go over some of the more
common Python tools available for working with GIS data, and show
examples of use-cases. Although I'll briefly touch on major GIS industry
players, my main focus will be on easily-accessible, free &amp;amp; open source
tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an all-levels talk: like the title says, this is for &amp;quot;Python
People&amp;quot;! Whether you consider yourself a seasoned Python developer, an
enthusiastic fan, or are just getting started: you should be able to
learn something new while following along with the concepts &amp;amp; examples
I'll discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
