Abstract
Secrets come in many forms, passwords, keys, tokens. All crucial for the operation of an application, but each dangerous in its own way. In the past, many of us have pasted those secrets in to a text file and moved on, but in a world of config automation and ephemeral microservices these patterns are leaving our data at greater risk than ever before.
​
New tools, products, and libraries are being released all the time to try to cope with this massive rise in threats, both new and old-but-ignored. This talk will cover the major types of secrets in a normal web application, how to model their security properties, what tools are best for each situation, and how to use them with major Python frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;

challenge over the years. As best-practices have evolved, it has become
progressively more time-consuming to keep up with what tools exist and
how to use them effectively. This talk will provide an overview of the
ecosystem and provide pointers for more information about individual
components or problems.&lt;/p&gt;
