programming language. Rather than treat testing as a “necessary evil,”
Python offers a number of versatile test frameworks to make it fun and
easy. This talk will cover basic testing best practices and introduce
a few of the popular frameworks, including unittest, doctest, py.test,
Nose, and Avocado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing is vital to the success of any software, including big data
and analytics code. Unfortunately, it is often regarded as a
“necessary evil” – extra work that slows down progress. In this
session, I will highlight how testing in Python can be fun, easy,
fast, and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I will give a brief overview of basic best practices for
testing. We will talk about the difference between debugging and
testing, different types of tests, how to write good test cases, and
basic testing fixtures like assertions and results. I will focus on
unit testing, but the concepts can be applied to higher levels of
testing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, for the majority of the session, I will introduce different
Python test frameworks: - unittest as the standard module for unit
test classes. - doctest as a lightweight way to write short, self-
documenting assertions in docstrings. - py.test as a way to write very
concise test cases. - Nose as an extension of unittest with added
features. - Avocado as a comprehensive framework with parameters,
replay, and test discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is designed to be useful to Python programmers of any skill
level. Only a basic understanding of Python is required.&lt;/p&gt;
