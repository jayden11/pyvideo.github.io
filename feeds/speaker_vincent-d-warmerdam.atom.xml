In this talk I will explain the idea of sampling to get to your model and I will demonstrate it with examples. The goal is to start with a for loop and to end with understanding how MCMC algorithms work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
A lot of people understand the scikit-learn models of todays world but feel uneasy about the whole MCMC method of training. Why are these algorithms different? How is it that you don't use a gradient method but a sampler instead? It can feel a bit misterious if you've not properly been introduced to this other way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will explain the idea of sampling to get to your model and I will demonstrate it with examples. The goal is to start with a for loop and to end with understanding how MCMC algorithms work. As a consequence the audience will also get a proper introduction to PyMC3. In particular I will discuss the following;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why markov chain sampling can be equivalent to direct sampling
how to build your own MCMC sampler with a for loop
how this for loop can be run faster by using PyMC3 instead
the key idea of inference and how i was briefly able apply it in a santa kaggle competition
how to analyse timeseries with MCMC in PyMC3
Parts of this talk are readily available on my blog;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will give many examples of when Bayes rule will help you in your day to day work. I'll quickly show many examples of bayesian statistical thinking in action; the pleasure of inference, probabilistic graphs, model selection, feature generation, even operations research! I'll finish with a dataset from Heroes of the Storm and I'll show why Bayesian models can outperform randomforests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk is made up of the following examples;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;basic disease example: what is the value of adding an extra test to a patient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give an example of an inference task that is very hard to do properly without bayesian thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating simple probibalistic models with pandas and showing how they are robust against missing data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demo the daft, corner and pomegrenate library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show how you can use bayes rule to pick models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demo a bayesian probablistic approach to finding overpowered characters in the Heroes of the Storm video game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
