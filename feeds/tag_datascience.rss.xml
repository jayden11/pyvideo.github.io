The objective is to showcase the power and flexibility of combining preexisting python modules and apply them to the field of facial detection and machine learning.
Correctly positioning a mustache on any given face in a straight forward and fun example of applying the technology in a 30 min presentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use an elementary task as a vehicle for explaining and demonstrating the complexities of shape recognition, object classifiers and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will demonstrate the use of image pyramids for image scaling and blending.
The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection.
Finding the location of different facial features (e.g. corners of the eyes, eyebrows, and the mouth, the tip of the nose etc.) accurately will be described.
Facial landmarks are used to align facial images to a mean face shape. How this allows the blending of images will be described and demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a girl and want a mustache, you can’t just grow one, so you have to steal one.
I developed this project on raspberry pi and python. I wanted to do something different on that platform. I felt there were too many people who used their Rpi to feed their dog, water their plants or play MP3. I knew the platform had more potential than that. Hopefully this talk will help people think differently about Rpi3.
Attendees will learn tips on image processing, as well as training your own object classifier.
Showcasing the power of python in a fun, lighthearted way. Hopefully, being informative and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2001 Bill Clinton unveiled &amp;quot;the most important, most wondrous map ever produced by humankind&amp;quot; - the human genome. This monumental endeavour cost $3 billion, and took hundreds of scientists from all over the world 13 years. Today, a single person can generate such a map in ~2 days for $1000. This dramatic drop in cost means that we now have data for hundreds of thousands of people - and other species - from all corners of the globe, and cohorts are available for every major disease under the sun. Petabytes of new data are also being generated every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this data is publicly available, so anyone with an internet connection can try in silico biology from the comfort of their own home. In my talk, I'll walk through what this data looks like, and how it's analysed - with a special focus on where python fits into the workflow (;tldr the most interesting parts!). I will also highlight some common pitfalls software engineers and developers face when getting into this space. Finally, I'll showcase several other facets of bioinformatics that sorely need contributions from good coders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genomics is rapidly entering the world of health care in both the public and private hospital sectors, and in direct-to-consumer genetic testing. Understanding this data, the challenges and limitations of its analytics will help us all make better-informed health and medical decisions, affecting our quality of life and those we love.&lt;/p&gt;

Xarray is n-dimensional array package bringing numpy and pandas-style interfaces to labelled data.  Its main use is for manipulating scientific datasets stored in NetCDF file format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dask package brings task graphs for parallel computation of arrays, by breaking them up into smaller chunks, for lazy processing of arrays. It can handle larger-than-memory dataset, scaling from a single machine to a cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When used together, then can be used to analyse all sorts of scientific data.  This talk will look at using them to analyse a timeseries of Earth-observation from Landsat satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

The Virtual Brain (TVB) is an open-source scientific software written in
Python for advanced simulations of complex brain dynamics. TVB can be used in
a client-server configuration, such that its web-based interface can be
accessed remotely, or as a standalone cross-platform Python library through a
scripting interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will begin by briefly explaining the motivations and science
behind TVB. This will be followed by a description of TVB's architecture and
main functionalities, including: simulation of neural activity; modification
and visualization of brain connectivity and network dynamics; and, analysis
of time-series. Lastly, I will show you that getting started with brain
simulations is just one Jupyter notebook away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With TVB you might not be able to build smart brains (yet), but you can build
one of the most realistic approximations to the physics of a human brain.&lt;/p&gt;

Most 'data science' projects fall into just a few well-understood design patterns. This talk de-mystifies what those patterns are, how to use them practically, and how to get to grips with your data. We'll a look at how to understand the input/output structure of the models, how to design a reasonable 'experiment', and how to get started. We'll look at getting to grips with problems by simple data sets that can fit entirely on-screen, designing the basic 'form' of the machine before levelling up to bigger data and badder algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this will be shown using Python tools, libraries and running code.&lt;/p&gt;

Python programming language is extensively used in Geoscience Australia (www.ga.gov.au) for scientific computing. In particular, a datacube system has been developed recently using Python as a core technology. The system manages petabyte-scale earth-observation satellite imagery datasets. And has enabled a wide range of applications such as the Water Observation from Space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about how Geoscience Australia applies scientific computing (Python) to the big data challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

The recently released TensorFlow library has caused great waves in machine learning circles, with its powerful syntax that allows for distributed computation, improved efficiency, and modularisation. The framework allows you to build graph-based models, such as those used in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and have those models run on a distributed computing systems, including GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover what TensorFlow is, why/when you should use it, and cover the basics surrounding Variables, Placeholders, and Custom Functions. Importantly, there are several use cases &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; focused on data analytics - TensorFlow is more than just a machine learning library!&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will give an overview of a water forecasting system, which exposes via Python a suite of tools developed in C++ for hydrologists to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PySWIFT is a Python software system that allows the use of SWIFT (Short-term Water Information and Forecasting Tools), a hydrologic suite of tools for flood and short-term streamflow forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When integrating the SWIFT C++ system with Python, we aimed to achieve two main goals:
1. Provide a productive and interactive environment for hydrological modelling.
2. Take advantage of a complex multi-threaded C++ suite of tools that enables rapid execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve the first goal, we created a modelling environment using JupyterHub. In this environment, modellers can set up, run, inspect and modify models, which is ideal to conduct exploratory experiments with the models.
To achieve the second goal, we used CFFI to create a Python wrapper for SWIFT’s API. CFFI allows us to interact with SWIFT’s C interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we will highlight the challenges and learnings that came about whilst building this system.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the past five years, Python has skyrocketed in popularity in the scientific world, pushing out proprietary languages such as IDL and Matlab. This rise was powered by simple syntax and efficient numerical libraries. But many operations in Python are still slow, and upstart languages, such as Julia and Go, promise simplicity &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; speed. Can Python cement its place in scientific computing?&lt;/p&gt;

Presented with Maoyuan Liu from the Bureau of Meteorology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupyter notebooks have become a very popular tool for scientific data analysis and exploration. Often notebook users may produce a data analysis within a notebook and decide they wish to share it with a wider audience. While notebooks offer excellent facilities for data visualisation, they are less than ideal as a medium for sharing these visualisations more broadly. Interacting with data in a notebook requires knowledge of programming. Notebooks with static data displays are more accessible to non-technical audiences, but static displays severely limit the breadth and depth of data that can be explored within one notebook. So the question arises: How can we provide our audience with the ability to explore our data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing interactive data displays for the web typically requires knowledge of web technologies that notebook users may not possess. To bridge this gap, a flurry of recent activity has focussed on the development of tools that facilitate interactivity within notebooks. Such tools include interactive plotting tools that enable actions such as zooming and selecting of data within plots, user interface elements (eg. drop-down menus, sliders) that can be incorporated into notebooks, and tools that facilitate the arrangement of plots and information into dashboard-like displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology has used these tools to build shareable interactive data displays comparing weather forecasts against observations across Australia. In this talk we will review currently available tools that facilitate interactivity within notebooks, share our experience in using them, and the practices we have developed around their use. A simple step-by-step example will demonstrate how we can put together an interactive data display allowing selective plotting of data through UI controls and interaction with the plots.&lt;/p&gt;
