&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests, I used to hate them, and actually when I start writing tests on a
new project I still do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, you don't have to be scared about them, and I'd like to cover
developing your testing strategy, what to test, what not to test, and
how to explain how to convince higher ups that its not just a useful
spending of time, its a vital part of your job.&lt;/p&gt;
