availability, durability, fault-tolerance and scalability. Besides
providing support for message and notification services through
OpenStack, Zaqar aims to ease the design of distributed systems and
allow for asynchronous work distribution without creating yet another
message broker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to give the audience as much information as possible
about Zaqar's architecture, design, patterns, performance, issues it
faced and how why it was built from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
