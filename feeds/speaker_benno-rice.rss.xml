&lt;p&gt;Presented by Benno Rice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you've developed your application, it appears to work and you may
even have some tests to back that up. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One part of software development that tends to receive not nearly enough
attention is the process of deploying, supporting and maintaining your
code in production. This demonstration will give an overview of using
tools such as Hudson, nose, stdeb and freshen to automate the testing,
packaging, deployment and verification of production software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behave is a tool for behaviour-driven development inspired by the
Cucumber tool for Ruby. It allows developers and stakeholders to agree
on how a particular piece of software should behave using an
English-like Given-When- Then syntax and for that behaviour for then to
be easily tested in whatever manner is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will provide an introduction to behaviour-driven
development, behaviour testing in general and the behave tool along with
its advantages over alternatives such as lettuce and freshen.&lt;/p&gt;
