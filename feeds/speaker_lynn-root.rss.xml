service? Perhaps it’s highly distributed? Or you recently walked onto a
team with an unfamiliar codebase? Have you noticed your service responds
slower than molasses? This talk will walk you through how to pinpoint
bottlenecks, approaches and tools to make improvements, and make you
seem like the hero! All in a day’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will describe various types of tracing a web service, including
black &amp;amp; white box tracing, tracing distributed systems, as well as
various tools and external services available to measure performance.
I’ll also present a few different rabbit holes to dive into when trying
to improve your service’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

[EuroPython 2015]
[23 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
[Education Summit]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past few years, we have made large strides to welcome more diverse
people into our community.  You see better gender ratios in attendance
numbers at Python conferences, the billed speakers, the amount of
women-centric programs.  We can see the benefits of outreach.  But
we're not done yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a lot of the Python community embraces the importance of being
diverse, we haven't taken that mindset to our workplace.  From
recruiting, we still hear, &amp;quot;sure, we wanted to recruit women, but we
couldn't find them&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;we only focus on quality here, not gender!&amp;quot;
Within company cultures, we hear &amp;quot;gender equality isn't a problem
here!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;women don't ask for a higher salary&amp;quot; and to &amp;quot;just lean in!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will recount the diversity efforts of the past few years and
quantify the effects on the Python community.  But this talk will also
address the not-so-low-hanging fruit; the  deeper-rooted problems that
still plague the community from inside where we work.  And it will
talk the audience through actionable items to improve one's work place
that welcomes more diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

[EuroPython 2015]
[20 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Spotify, my team struggled to be awesome.  We had a very loose
understanding of what product/service our squad was responsible for,
and even less so of the expectations our internal and external
customers had for those services.  Other than “does our Facebook login
work?”, we had no understanding of how our services we’re responsible
for were doing.  How many users actually sign up or log in with
Facebook? How many users have connected their Spotify account with
their Uber account?  Do folks even use Spotify with Uber?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a 2-month challenge period, my squad and I focused inward to
establish those unanswered questions and to establish feedback loops
and always-on dashboards.  This talk will tell the story of how we
chose which metrics are important for us to focus on, what
technologies we have used and are using, and how we’ve iterated over
our feedback loops to fine-tune what metrics we care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many folks in the Python community appreciate and contribute to Free and Open Source Software. But sometimes, your employer may not be on your side. We will present the current problem space that both community members and companies have for using and supporting FOSS. We will then walk you through arguments and solutions to help increase your company's engagement with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you a woman wanting to break into the engineering field? Or do you
know any women wanting to learn how to code, but don’t know how to help
them? Perhaps our nerdy ladies are a bit shy to ask for help. That’s
okay! I’ll give you some tools to nudge you in the right direction. In
this session, Iâ??ll be talking about how I increased womenâ??s
engagement in the Python community though demonstrating how versatile
the language is with practical projects, by creating a safe space for
women to learn and to fail, and by encouraging involvement beyond the
classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

But your friends can't see it - what's wrong? I'm
betting DNS. Maybe you've fixed a couple of entries, point some records
to hostnames, waited patiently for new domains to resolve only to notice
your nameservers are incorrect. But what actually goes on with DNS? Come
to this talk to find out how DNS works, and how to interact and create a
DNS with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following instructions of what entries to create where is easy enough
when using a PaaS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But DNS is hard – deployment issues always seem to come down to DNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solid understanding of DNS will not only help with deploying your
applications, but will also give a greater understanding of how the
internet works, and more generally, distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you will learn what DNS is, how it works and how to
communicate with it, and how Python can make both interacting and
spinning up your own DNS server simple (I swear!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intro (1-2m)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What DNS is (5 min)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;URL -&amp;gt; IP addr, e.g. &amp;quot;phonebook&amp;quot; lookup (obligatory pun: Call me,
Maybe?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hierarchical system &amp;amp; resolution sequence (local DNS
cache/resolver, ISP resolver, recursive DNS search)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;popular types (primary, secondary/slave, forwarding, authoritative
only, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System components: what makes a DNS?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to communicate with DNS (3 min)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protocol: UDP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operations: CRUD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource records (A, AAAA, CNAME, SOA, SRV, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tools: dig/nsupdate/nslookup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security overview (3min) (disclaimer: NOT a DNS security expert, not
planning to get into the details here)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server-Server, DynDNS: TSIG/GSS-TSIG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server-Client: DNSSEC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python + DNS (10 min)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plain UDP query in Python (no 3rd-party libraries/no magic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interacting with a DNS w/ Python (dnspython.py)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sample DNS server with Twisted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;fake&amp;quot; demo (either local or pre-recorded screen cast) of
querying/updating/etc of the Twisted DNS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrap up - resources page, github links, etc (1min)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q&amp;amp;A - ~5 min&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

their ability to take the pain out of server configuration, maintenance,
provisioning, data storage and other aspects of running a server. With
the recent outing of PRISM, a clandestine national security electronic
surveillance program, the next desirable IT feature is &amp;quot;not subject to
American law.&amp;quot; How can we leverage cloud-based software while
maintaining privacy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is a look at what exactly PRISM is, how PRISM affects cloud
services, and how best to approach securing data and preserving privacy
within the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

Great! But now what? I will present 5 digestible projects to gradually
progress the Python learner from near drowning to a decent swimmer. The
goal is to have new coders feeling accomplished and to continuing
learning.&lt;/p&gt;
