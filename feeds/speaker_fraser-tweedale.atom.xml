authorisation on the open web, but the requirements and technologies
used inside companies and large organisations are different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identities and groups are probably stored in an external identity
management system's directory rather than in an application's
database tables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authorisation decisions will be based on group membership and
policies that are defined outside the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users may be expected or required to use a &lt;em&gt;single sign-on&lt;/em&gt;
technology such as Kerberos or SAML to authenticate to applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will familiarise the audience with these technologies and
demonstrate how Python web applications can be integrated with an
identity management system to meet business requirements while providing
a positive user experience. Particular technologies covered will
include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.freeipa.org"&gt;FreeIPA&lt;/a&gt;: an open-source identity
management solution, for defining users, groups and authorisation
policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/modauthgssapi/mod_auth_gssapi"&gt;mod_auth_gssapi&lt;/a&gt;
/ mod_auth_kerb: Apache modules for Kerberos authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.adelton.com/apache/mod_lookup_identity/"&gt;mod_lookup_identity&lt;/a&gt;:
Apache module to retrieve user information from a directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will conclude with discussion about upcoming Kerberos features,
techniques for dealing with multiple authentication methods, and
progress in making identity management integration easier for Python
(and in particular, Django) developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People developing or deploying Python web applications in business
environments or for large open source projects with centralised identity
management will get the most out of this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

or replace traditional attribute access with arbitrary behaviours. Such
versatility makes the descriptor protocol a valuable tool for any Python
programmer, yet although most of us have used descriptors, fewer have
implemented one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will explain the use cases that motivate descriptors
and how other features in Python fall short. We will then look at some
of the descriptors that the audience may already have used (even if they
didn't know they were using descriptors!) This will be followed with an
explanation of the descriptor protocol and some implementation and usage
examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will discuss some of the finer details of descriptor implementation
and will conclude with a look at Elk - a declarative object system
authored by the presenter and inspired by Perl's Moose - and the
descriptors that power it.&lt;/p&gt;

Python's &amp;quot;cryptographic standard library&amp;quot;. It is designed to be easy to
use but flexible, exposing a &lt;em&gt;recipes&lt;/em&gt; layer for common use cases, and a
&lt;em&gt;hazmat&lt;/em&gt; layer that provides crypto primitives but demands users know
what they're doing in order to use them properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain the motivations and goals of the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cryptography&lt;/tt&gt;
library, take a tour of its features and discuss its implementation.
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cryptography&lt;/tt&gt; will be compared to some other popular and emerging
crypto libraries. Finally, we will examine some real-world use of the
library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audience members should have a passing familiarity with cryptography
(e.g. know the differences between hashing and encryption, or public key
and private key crypto) to get the most out of this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
