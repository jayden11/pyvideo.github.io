We can gain a lot of insight by analysing what happened when. The better the quality and accuracy of our data, the better our predictions can become.
Unfortunately the data we have to deal with is often aggregated for example on a monthly basis, but not all months are the same, they may have 28 days, 31 days, have four or five weekends,… It’s made fit to our calendar that was made fit to deal with the earth surrounding the sun, not to please Data Scientists.
Dealing with periodical data can be a challenge.
Pandas is a powerful framework for working with time series data and can make your life a lot easier.
This talks will feature:
how to analyse periodical data with pandasread and write data in various formatshow to mangle, reshape and pivotgain insights with statsmodels (e.g. seasonality)caveats when working with timed datavisualize your data on the fly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MongoDB aggregation framework provides a means to calculate
aggregated values without having to use map-reduce. While map-reduce
is powerful, it is often more difficult than necessary for many simple
aggregation tasks, such as totaling or averaging field values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how to use the build-in data-aggregation-pipelines for averages,
summation, grouping, reshaping. See how to work with documents, sub-
documents, grouping by year, month, day, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will give many (live) examples how to make the most of your
data with pymongo with a few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/game-theory-to-the-rescue-when-hard-decisions-are-to-be-made"&gt;https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/game-theory-to-the-rescue-when-hard-decisions-are-to-be-made&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's hard to decide when a something is really done or
cannot be improved further.
&lt;strong&gt;Game theory&lt;/strong&gt; can help you to make complicated decisions whenever
you encounter flow problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game theory is &amp;quot;the study of mathematical models of conflict and
cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our use case we had to match data  for accounting.  The data was
not always clean but we had some extra tools at hand and a complex
system to make good guesses. Nevertheless it was hard to decide when
to give up, some records were just not processable.
Finally we used Game theory to make the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
