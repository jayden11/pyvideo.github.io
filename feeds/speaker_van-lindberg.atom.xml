&lt;p&gt;Friday morning keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is a spectacular success - far more than anyone, even Guido, would have anticipated 20 years ago. Python is preinstalled on almost every operating system, is becoming the lingua franca for many numeric, statistical, and big data problems, and is the default teaching language in many colleges and universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our success does not hide the warning signs. Javascript, Julia, Java, Lua, and Go are all picking up speed and mindshare, frequently at the expense of Python. What do these languages and language communities have that is enticing others to pick them? How can we learn from the good ideas in these languages to make Python even stronger? How can we interoperate and build on what they have?&lt;/p&gt;

It has always been faster and cheaper to do our processing with a powerful centralized processor than a group of lower-powered processors at the edges. This is changing. The last couple years have brought a new focus on scale-out and distributed architectures, but that is not enough. We are getting to the place where vastly more data, and vastly more compute power, will be available at the edges of our networks. How should this change how we approach the the future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder how if you google “When was Python created?” Google just has the answer in a box at the top for you?  In this talk we’ll investigate how information extraction systems work, implement one using scikit-learn and NLTK, and learn about natural language processing along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Van Lindberg has worked professionally as an engineer, as a lawyer, and as an executive. He currently has a dual legal/technical role at Rackspace, and has worked out of both the legal department and the Office of the CTO. In April 2012, the American Bar Association Journal named Van as one of &amp;quot;America's Top 12 Techiest Attorneys.&amp;quot; He has been involved with open source since 1994, when a friend introduced him to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the legal side, Van leads Rackspace's Intellectual Property program, directing Rackspace's strategy and policy around patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and open source matters. Van also heads Rackspace's lobbying efforts relative to patent reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the technical side, Van runs Rackspace's technical leadership corps, known internally as the &amp;quot;TCT.&amp;quot; Van also works in technical strategy and ecosystem engagement at Rackspace, identifying emerging technologies, separating out differentiating versus non-differentiating product elements, and using open source strategies to be more competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Van worked at the law firm of Haynes and Boone, where he wrote &amp;quot;Intellectual Property and Open Source,&amp;quot; published by O'Reilly and Associates, and grew an open source practice helping businesses with everything from open source compliance to business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Van's open source practice, he did IP transactional work, patent prosecution, litigation, and post-grant actions (ex parte and inter partes reexams/reviews).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van currently serves as chairman of the board of the Python Software Foundation, on the board of the OpenStack Foundation, and as the chair of the Docker Governance Advisory Board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the right piece of &amp;quot;prior art&amp;quot; - technical documentation that
described a patented piece of technology before the patent was filed -
is like finding a needle in a very big haystack. This session will talk
about how I am making that process faster and more accurate through the
use of natural language processing, graph theory, machine learning, and
lots of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my work consulting on a number of patent cases, I am frequently
asked to find &amp;quot;prior art&amp;quot; - patents and publications that describe a
technology before a certain date. The problem is that the indexing
mechanisms for patents and publications are not as good as they could
be, making good prior art searching more of an art than a science. When
I decided to do better, I reached for Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part I (5 mins): The USPTO as a data source.* The full-text of each
patent is available from the USPTO (and now from Google.) What does
this data look like? How can it be harvested and normalized to create
data structures that we can work with?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part II (15 mins, in two parts):* Once the patents have been cleaned
and normalized, they can be turned into data structures that we can
use to evaluate their relationship to other documents. This is done
in two ways - by modeling each patent as a document vector and a
graph node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part IIA (7 mins): Patents as document vectors.* Once we have a
patent as a data structure, we can treat the patent as a vector in an
n-dimensional space. In moving from a document into a vector space,
we will touch on normalization, stemming, TF/IDF, Latent Semantic
Indexing (LSI) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part IIB (7 mins): Patents as technology graphs.* This will show
building graph structures using the connections between patents -
both the built-in connections in the patents themselves as well as
the connections discovered while working with the patents as vectors.
We apply some social network analysis to partition the patent graph
and find other documents in the same technology space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part III (5 mins): What have we built?* Now that we have done all
this analysis, we can see some interesting things about the patent
database as a whole. How does the patent database act as a map to the
world of technology? And how has this helped with the original
problem - finding better prior art?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
