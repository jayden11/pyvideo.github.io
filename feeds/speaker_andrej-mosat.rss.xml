processors like ARM, x86. It allows developers to quickly and
effectively write code directly for hardware without the need for
compiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of an interpreted language is mainly in removing the
compilation time. Errors appear when executing the program, the response
is immediate. The disadvantages include an increased demand for memory
and unscheduled pause due to the garbage collector. I will introduce
development platforms running interpreted languages, their advantages
and disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main part of the lecture will be devoted to basic hardware
development using examples such as switches, LEDs, potentiometers and
interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
