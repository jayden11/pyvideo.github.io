models that determines fitness of publicly available populations and
models and assumptions. The Reference Model has grown to the point that
it was hard to maintain the code base and increase the number of
populations. Recent advances with the MIcro Simulation Tool (MIST), that
runs the model, allow object oriented population generation.
Evolutionary Computation, using the Python Inspyred library by Aaron
Garrett, is a key element in MIST population generation. Recent
developments allow easier introductions of variations in population
generation to figure out fitness of unknown base assumptions. This is
powerful in conjunction with High Performance Computing that allows
testing multiple modeling assumptions in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a modeling and simulation

activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors: Jacob Barhak&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track: Bioinformatics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIST stands for Misco-Simulation Tool. It is a modeling and simulation
framework that supports computational Chronic Disease Modeling
activities. It is a fork from the IEST = Indirect Estimation and
Simulation Tool GPL modeling framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIST removes complexity associated with the estimation engine, with
parameter definitions, and with rule restrictions. This significantly
simplifies the system and allows its development in the Micro-simulation
path less encumbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incentive to split MIST was to adapt the code to use newer compiler
technology to speed up simulations. There is wrong skepticism in the
medical disease modeling community towards using Interpreters for
simulations due to performance issues. The use of advanced compiler
technology with Python may remedy this misconception and provide
optimized python based simulations. MIST is a first step in this
direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIST takes care of a few documented and known issues. It also moves to
use new scientific Python stacks such as Anaconda and PythonXY as its
platform. This improves its accessibility to less sophisticated users
that can now benefit from easier installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reference Model for disease progression intends to use MIST as its
main platform. Yet MIST is equipped with a Micro-simulation compiler
designed to accommodate Monte Carlo simulations for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
