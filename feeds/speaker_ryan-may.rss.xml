In order to keep code working and in good shape, and minimize the accrual of technical debt, the project developers have focused on making use of many cloud services to automate the development of the project. These services accomplish: static code analysis, continuous integration testing, automated documentation builds, and automated releases. We will present our experiences of how these services have helped with development, as well as challenges that presented themselves, with the goal to encourage others to use those to support their own development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

scientific Python community. This tutorial covers advanced features of
the Matplotlib library, including many recent additions: laying out
axes, animation support, Basemap (for plotting on maps), and other
tweaks for creating aesthetic plots. The goal of this tutorial is to
expose attendees to several of the chief sub- packages within
Matplotlib, helping to ensure that users maximize the use of the full
capabilities of the library. Additionally, the attendees will be run
through a 'grab-bag' of tweaks for plots that help to increase the
aesthetic appeal of created figures. Attendees should be familiar with
creating basic plots in Matplotlib as well as basic use of NumPy for
manipulating data.&lt;/p&gt;
