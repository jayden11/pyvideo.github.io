your deployment pipeline, acting as the glue needed to pull together
loosely- coupled deployment tooling. This talk will discuss how the
author used Github's Deployments API to connect a chatbot to a custom CI
server, allowing for chat-based deploys to a custom Docker-based
infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Jay Parlar Bio&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jay is a Hamilton-based software developer at Rackspace, working on
internal tools to improve the quality of life of his coworkers. He
spends his days writing JavaScript and Python, contributing both to
front-end and back-end systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He earned his Ph.D. in Software Engineering from McMaster University,
where he focused on hard real-time embedded systems and vibration
analysis, topics that have little-to-nothing to do with his current job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of work, Jay spends most of his time with his wife and three
kids.&lt;/p&gt;
