parallelize development, and scale high traffic apps. One of the
downsides of service oriented web applications, however, is managing the
high overhead of communication between services, and handling the
additional complexities that come along with service driven development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, Randall Degges, Stormpath Developer Evangelist and
OpenCNAM co-founder, will share all of the best practices he learned
while building OpenCNAM, supporting billions of API requests.&lt;/p&gt;
