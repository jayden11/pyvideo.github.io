&lt;p&gt;The software industry as a whole is moving further towards integrating smaller systems together rather than building monoliths. This can be trickier than it appears, especially when the system needs to grow and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is meant to help highlight some of the pitfalls that can trip up teams who may be used to creating smaller systems or monoliths, take a look at deployment, scaling and monitoring and discuss issues that are still problematic for us here at EnergyDeck.&lt;/p&gt;
