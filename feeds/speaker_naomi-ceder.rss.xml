In addition both the demand for more tech talent and basic fairness also support increased diversity and inclusion. Just as there is no single easy way to write good code there is no single easy way to increase diversity. There are, however, several things that companies and organizations do which actually work against diversity. This talk will explore these anti-patterns for diversity, including uncritical belief in meritocracy, lack of understanding of the realities of marginalization, null processes, misunderstanding of “culture fit”, and an unwillingness to change, as well as some ways that teams, companies, and organizations might work to combat them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop doing the same thing but expecting different results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As developers we put considerable effort into optimisation. We are
always tinkering, trying to make things better, and striving to remove
antipatterns from our code and our development processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet for some reason we have not been as good at applying this spirit
of optimisation to the problem of increasing diversity, even though
most people these days agree that, like good tests, agile
methodologies, and virtual environments, diversity is a &amp;quot;good thing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My position is that just as there is no single easy way to write good
code there is no single easy way to increasing diversity. There are,
however, several things that companies and organisations do which
actually work against diversity. This talk will explore these
antipatterns for diversity, including uncritical belief in
meritocracy, lack of understanding of the realities of
marginalisation, null processes, misunderstanding of &amp;quot;culture fit&amp;quot;,
and an unwillingness to change, as well as some ways that teams,
companies, and organisations might work to combat them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Python the language is wonderful, the Python community and the
personal, social, and professional benefits that flow from involvement
in a community like ours are often more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn about the goals of the Python Software Foundation and how
everyone can take part to help build even better Python communities
locally, regionally, and globally.  I will also discuss some of our
strengths as a community, and also look at some of the challenges we
face going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is a powerful and flexible tool that many of us love and use in
many ways. And yet, as wonderful as  the language is, many would say
that the community is even more attractive. This talk will focus on
involvement in the Python community and what that means - in
particular the many personal, social, and professional benefits that
flow from involvement in a community like ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also discuss what the Python Software Foundation does, what its
goals and purpose are, and how everyone in the community can take part
in the PSF to help build even better Python communities. This will
include specific explanations of the membership model and how active
contributors (both in terms of code and community organisation) can
and should become full voting members of the PSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also touch on our strengths, like our commitment to safe and
inclusive spaces and our devotion to education, and also look at some
of the challenges we face as a community going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as there is no single easy way to write good code there is no single easy way to increase diversity. There are, however, several things we (yes, even in the Python community) do which actually work against diversity. This talk will explore these anti-patterns for diversity,  as well as some ways that teams, companies, and organizations might work to combat them.&lt;/p&gt;

involved in the Python community. This talk discusses that transition
and explores how I found life in Python as a woman different from my
former life as a man and the lessons about diversity I have learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After half a lifetime &amp;quot;undercover as a man&amp;quot; I transitioned from male to
female while staying involved in the Python community. This talk
discusses that transition and explores how I found life in Python as a
woman different from my former life as a man and the lessons about
diversity I have learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will include a brief discussion of what being transgender
means, my experiences as I came to terms with it, and the losses and
gains transition entailed. Early on I made the decision to be as open as
possible and to stay engaged in the Python community as I transitioned
and I will discuss why I made that decision and the levels of acceptance
and support I encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition has been wonderfully successful, but that very transition put
me in a surprisingly different world. Now being part of not one, but at
least 3 groups that are minorities in the Python world gave me a very
different view of a community I thought I knew, and pushed me to being
an activist (or trouble maker) in spite of myself. In addition to the
many positives the Python community has offered me on my journey, I will
discuss the experiences that have made me understand that privilege is
very much alive and well in the Python world.&lt;/p&gt;
