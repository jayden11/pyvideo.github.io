&lt;p&gt;Micro Python is a rewrite of the Python language that uses minimal RAM and which is optimised to run on a microcontroller (basically a very small computer). I will outline the architecture of Micro Python, explain how it minimises RAM usage, and discuss its benefits and use in the embedded electronics world.&lt;/p&gt;

MicroPython is a lean and efficient reimplementation of Python 3 with a
reduced standard library, and brings the awesomeness of Python to computing
devices with few resources, such as microcontrollers.  In this talk I will
detail my journey in building MicroPython and the various projects that it
has been used in and the people who are using it.  I will talk about running
a successful Kickstarter campaign (actually two of them!), circuit board
manufacturing, working with the European Space Agency, working with the BBC
on the micro:bit project, and the challenges of managing and funding
open-source software.  There will also be some live demos!&lt;/p&gt;

These devices are getting more and more sophisticated and it can be beneficial to program them with a scripting language instead of a low-level language like C. Such scripting languages need to be implemented specifically to fit and run on a microcontroller and in this talk I will discuss a few of them: Python, Lua, JavaScript and Ruby. I will talk in detail about MicroPython, a lean and efficient reimplementation of Python 3 with a reduced standard library, that runs on microcontrollers and can be used to build Internet-of-Things devices. There will be plenty of time in the talk for questions and open discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
