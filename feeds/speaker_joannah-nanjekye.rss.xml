the various contributions to its open source infrastructure and
projects. Research shows most python open source infrastructure and
projects are survived by an average of two contributors and yet
companies are building palaces using this python open source
infrastructure and projects since it's usually very easy to find the
upstream source for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shall focus on why python developers need to contribute to the
python open source infrastructure and projects now more than before, how
one can contribute to python open source Infrastructure and projects and
what prominent python open source Infrastructure and projects are
available to contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk, we will discuss what open source really is, the
difference between open source software and free software, licenses
involved in open source software, why python project owners need to make
their software open source, why python developers and students need to
contribute to python open source Infrastructure and projects now more
than ever , what python open source infrastructure Infrastructure and
projects contribution opportunities students have during summer. We will
also have a walk-through of submitting a pull request to a python open
source project using qutebrowser for an example for attendees who have
never contributed to open source before.&lt;/p&gt;
