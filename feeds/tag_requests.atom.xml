&lt;p&gt;Presented by Graham Dumpleton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will cover the challenges of creating a production
application performance monitoring system for Python. It includes an
overview of the architecture of the system, as well as how it hooks into
Django and captures details about web transactions, database
transactions, memcache requests, exceptions and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you run on CPython, it's not possible to get a single-process,
multithreaded Python program to use more than one CPU core at a time
because of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). A common way of dealing
with this is to run one instance of a Python program for each core a
machine has and spread the load amongst those processes. This forces
developers to write simple, stateless programs that naturally scale out
to many many servers when needed, while also not having to think about
things like locking and thread scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll discuss some tools and methods Spotify's backend uses for managing
multiple identical server processes as well as load balancing with DNS,
proxy servers, and using hashing to send repeated requests to the same
process. I will also talk about the difficulties that arise when you
really need to share data or state between processes, and how they can
be dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;
