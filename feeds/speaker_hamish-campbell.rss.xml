But just how
many &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; polyominos are there? Solving this question is one of our
favourite interview questions and the techniques that can employed to
solve it are instructive for a range of problems. In this talk, we
discuss the potential solutions and offer prizes for the best solutions
submitted by the end of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#64; Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Saturday, 07 Sep 2013 - Track 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;Polyomino&amp;quot; is a geometric figure of adjacent squares. But just how
many &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; polyominos are there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question has been one of our favourite interview questions. It's a
deceptively simple problem with opportunities for innovative solutions
and disastrous missteps. In this talk, we'll discuss the benefits of a
number of approaches, demonstrate a few common pitfalls and challenge
the audience to provide their own solutions, with prizes on offer at the
end of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a talk for everyone: beginners will be introduced to a problem
that can be solved using primitives, experts will see opportunities to
deploy advanced optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
