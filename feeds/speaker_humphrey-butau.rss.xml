about considerably over the past few years. It is a way of programming
that aims to achieve good quality code, by specifying your problems
through writing tests first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my tutorial i will introduce the core concepts of TDD through
creating a simple web application using Python &amp;amp; Django. I will explain
in detail the TDD workflow. Attendees to this tutorial will be
introduced to functional testing with Selenium and to unit testing with
the Python Standard Library`s unittest Module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tutorial is aimed at beginners to Test Driven Development. I expect
attendees to have some familiarity with python and Django.&lt;/p&gt;
