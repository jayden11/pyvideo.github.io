teaching/learning process as well as research so much so that the 21st
century academic activities in science and engineering (S &amp;amp; E) cannot be
fully engaged without some level of computation. An important choice of
a programming language especially in a developing country is the ease to
learn it and its accessibility. Python's unique features and the
possibility that any user connected to the internet can download the
entire packages into any platform, install it and immediately begin to
use it makes it a preferred environment for introducing students and new
beginners to elegant and all purpose programming. Therefore in Africa,
the Python African Tour project has been launched and I am coordinating
its use in computational Science and Engineering (S &amp;amp; E) code-named
Python African Computational Science and Engineering Tour (PACSET).&lt;/p&gt;
