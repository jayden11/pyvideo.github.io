Graphical User Interface with Python is a tricky business. Come and learn a bit about Kivy and learn about my successes and failures using it with my Senior Software Development students (in NSW) to introduce GUI and App development with Python.
In this workshop you'll be introduced to the Kivy library, the tagging and formatting in kv files, setting up the python classes to support the UI and passing parameters between them.
The workshop is not really suitable for the Python beginner because we need to play around with classes and methods (one of the challenges with using it in the classroom) but will otherwise be a fairly measured pace.&lt;/p&gt;
