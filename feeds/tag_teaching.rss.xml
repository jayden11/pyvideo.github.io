&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyChart is a very nice program for producing print quality graphs.
However, it came equipped with a rather strange API, where every class
was called T. It was also using the global namespace in strange and
disturbing ways. Furthermore, it mixed multiple distinct tasks in some
classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show how I went about refactoring the package in order to make a
nice and clean API. This talk is focused on teaching refactoring
methodology to beginner and intermediate level programmers. It will also
give a brief introduction to how to make beautiful graphs with PyChart.&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sydney.edu.au/it/gpn"&gt;http://sydney.edu.au/it/gpn&lt;/a&gt;). For the past four years we have been
teaching Python to students in grades 9-12, and based on this experience
we will discuss why Python is a good first language and the parts of it
which are still difficult for students to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

programming competition for Australian high school students. There are
four different courses being run during 2011: Introductory Python,
Intermediate Python, Advanced Python, and Embedded Systems (using the
Arduino). In 2010 we had over 1700 students participate in the
Challenge. There are a number of interesting technical challenges which
had to be overcome in order to facilitate such a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For over a year, HackLabTO (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hacklab.to/"&gt;http://hacklab.to&lt;/a&gt;),
a hackerspace in Toronto, has been the home of an informal Python class
/ hack night every Thursday evening. Our participants represent a
diverse cross- section of the lab's community, and include everyone from
complete beginners who hadn't written code since BASIC in high school,
to seasoned veterans. Come hear about our successes and failures, and
learn how to start such an event in your local community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panel with Joel Zachary Miller, Jeffrey Elkner, Vern Ceder, Brian C.
Brumley, Maria Litvin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators discuss Python as both a subject and a tool in primary and
secondary (K12) education. Topics addressed include the distinction
between teaching Python and teaching with Python, the benefits of Python
in K12 and ways to demonstrate the value of Python to administrators.
Panel includes private and public K12 educators and university faculty
involved in instruction in the K12 setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zac Miller will act as panel moderator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panel will open with a brief introduction of the origins of the panel
and self introductions of panel members before addressing the following
topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The distinction between teaching Python and teaching with Python.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaching Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaching Math with Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Teaching with Python complement Teaching Python?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do tensions between the two exist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What keeps Python out of schools? What can be done to encourage more
schools to teach tools like Python?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the biggest benefit teaching Python brings to your school and
students? What is the biggest benefit in general, beyond your school?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can teaching Python help spark creativity in those students who have
trouble exercising it?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When teaching Python a creativity divide becomes readily apparent
among students. Students with a high level of curiosity and
creativity constantly try new things on their own, while other
students are focused solely on completing the assignments for
grades. How can an instructor handle this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What tangible steps can an instructor take to encourage
creativity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the future look like for Python in K12 education, both at
our own schools and in general?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audience Questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panel Biographies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vern Ceder, Director of Technology, Canterbury School, Ft Wayne,
Indiana. The Canterbury School has been teaching at least a little
Python to every single 8th and 9th grader in the school since 2001, as
well as offering electives in Python, Java, C, etc. Vern also teaches
Python through Northwestern's Gifted Learning Links program
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/gll/"&gt;http://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/gll/&lt;/a&gt;) and is the author of The Quick
Python Book, 2nd ed (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.manning.com/ceder"&gt;http://www.manning.com/ceder&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria Litvin. Maria teaches Math and Computer Science at Phillips
Academy in Andover, MA, including &amp;quot;Introduction to Discrete Mathematics
and Programming in Python.&amp;quot; She also taught Python to Boston-area high
school teachers and to middle schoolers in Google's CAPE program. She's
co-author of several Computer Science textbooks, most recently
Mathematics for the Digital Age and Programming in Python
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.skylit.c%20om/mathandpython.html"&gt;www.skylit.com/mathandpython.html&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

on-line textbook: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with
Python. He also maintains the Open Book Project
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openbookproject.net/"&gt;http://openbookproject.net&lt;/a&gt;), which
contains several Python resources. Jeff has attended each PyCon held
thus far, often bringing students along with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Vern Ceder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining Python with inexpensive robots is a very effective way of
teaching programming at the middle and high school levels. Since Python
is easy to understand a constructivist approach is possible - students
learn by creating and running simple programs, observing the results,
and then modifying their code to fix bugs and add functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach suggested in this talk is partly based upon that developed
at the Institute for Personal Robots in Education
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.roboteducation.org/"&gt;http://wiki.roboteducation.org&lt;/a&gt;)
by staff from Georgia Tech and Bryn Mawr, combined with my own
experiences teaching programming with Python as described in my talk
&amp;quot;Goodbye, Hello World: Rethinking Teaching with Python&amp;quot;, PyCon 2007, and
my subsequent talks at NECC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because students are able to see what their code is doing and because
Python is easy to understand, students can explore simple programming
concepts, learning features as they need them. This approach increases
both student engagement and retention. It also seems that this approach
is more appealing to girls than a more traditional programming class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll illustrate my talk with samples of code created by students and
video of the students/robots in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction - school background, course structure, origin of approach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware and computer setup used&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial exercises and first projects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control of robot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program as sequence of commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic programming concepts - looping, branching, functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced projects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
* obstacle detection
* image processing
* simple AI approaches
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitfalls and strategies for using robots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions and Suggestions&lt;/p&gt;
