&lt;p&gt;Since the dawn of time man has harnessed the power of convolutional neural networks to understand fashion. In this presentation, I carry on the trend and discuss how we've built a general purpose visual fashion representation by simultaneously training against multiple objectives with multiple images per objective. There will be lots of pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fashion is a visual medium so it makes sense for our models of fashion to include visual features. In this presentation, I'll describe how we've build a general purpose visual fashion representation using CNNs. The network is multi-task (multiple labels per image), multi-image (multiple images per label) and it runs on multiple GPUs. We used the python library Chainer to fit the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll visually explore what is going on inside the black box of a neural network and discover how a fashion specific model sees the world differently from generic visual models. Lastly, I'll demonstrate some applications of the representation learned by the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial part of this presentation will be technical but the remainder will be accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
