&lt;p&gt;SaltStack is a thriving configuration management system written in
Python that leverages YAML and Jinja2 which, by now, probably needs no
introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover a brief summary of why we need configuration
management tools, followed by a full dive into SaltStack, its
features, pros and cons, how to use it and how to extend it. By the
end of this talk you will have gone from knowing little or nothing
about SaltStack, to being able to deploy your own setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be targeted to either seasoned Python developers who
are taking their first steps in the system administration world, or
established system administrators who secretly love Python and prefer
to stay away of configuration management systems based on other
languages.
Its advisable that attendees have some familiarity with Python as well
as with system administration concepts. Also, this presentation will
be focused on GNU/Linux systems, so it is expected that attendees are
comfortable with some of its concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SaltStack is a thriving configuration management system written in
Python that leverages YAML and Jinja2 which, by now, probably needs no
introduction. This talk will explore Salt beyond the minimum required
setup, targeting developers/sysadmins already using Salt, and those
considering making the switch from other systems but wishing to dive
deeper first. Attendees should be familiar with configuration
management systems and practices, and comfortable using and reading
YAML and Jinja syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much more to Salt than the basics. This talk will go beyond
the minimum required setup and will take a look at Salt under the
hood, which will appeal not only to system administrators, but will
also be more interesting to developers and to the DevOps community in
general as the talk progresses. Topics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction and basics review (master/minions, matching, grains, pillar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salt Mine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syndic node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State modules vs. runner modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Reactor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Event System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salt Beacons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salt API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees should be familiar with configuration management systems and
practices, and also feel comfortable using and reading YAML and Jinja
syntax. This talk is targeted to developers or sysadmins already using
Salt, and to those who are considering switching to it from other
systems but wish to dive deeper before making that decision. After the
talk, attendees will have a better grasp of the more advanced
possibilities that Salt brings, and be ready to apply them to their
use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
