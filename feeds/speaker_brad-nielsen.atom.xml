Python is an ideal first programming language for secondary school students due to the simplicity of its syntax, its enforced code formatting, and the extensibility of the language. Introducing Python to a school however, takes planning, an incremental approach, and modification to existing curriculum plans based on experience. In this presentation, you will be given an overview of how a high school has introduced Python through years 8-12. You will also learn about various Python packages and environments that can be of benefit to a school including: Python Turtle, Grok Learning, Pygame, Flask, and PythonAnywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

programming using Python easy. Flask has less 'magic' than Django and
therefore makes server requests and responses easier to understand for
students. Python Anywhere is a cloud server that allows you to easily
set up a live Flask or Django application. Students can develop and
debug code online without the hassle of installing and configuring their
development environments. This session will look at how Flask and Python
Anywhere was used in the classroom with a year 12 student cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
