&lt;p&gt;At Yelp, we ship code multiple times a day and have maintained this
pace as our team has grown to 300+ and our codebase to several million
lines of Python code. This talk explores the pain points we
experienced along the ways, how our service-oriented architecture
alleviates them, and the infrastructure we built to develop, test, and
deploy in this highly-distributed environment. As a case study, we’ll
be looking at the backend powering the new Yelp Business Owner Android
and iOS apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start, most of the development at Yelp occurred in a single,
monolithic web application, creatively named “yelp-main” (naming is
hard!). As the company grew, our developers were spending increasing
amounts of time trying to ship code. After recognizing this pain
point, we started experimenting with a service oriented architecture
to scale the development process, and so far it’s been a resounding
success. Over the course of the last three years, we’ve gone from
writing our first service to having over seventy production services.
Along the way, we’ve dabbled with Docker containers, Pyramid,
SQLAlchemy, uWSGI, gevent, and virtualenv in an effort to build the
next-generation service platform for our engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/building-service-interfaces-using-OpenAPI"&gt;https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/building-service-interfaces-using-OpenAPI&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered how to keep track of all of your services and their
APIs? I'm going to explore how to build your Python services with
OpenAPI/Swagger and how it helps you solve problems like communication
between services, request and response validation, and documentation
of your API. I'll also discuss some challenges you might face when
running Swagger in production, gathered from over a year of heavy
usage at Yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementing a service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a proven way to
split up large monolithic codebases and to scale development when your
organization grows to hundreds or thousands of engineers. I'm going to
explore how to build and document your services with OpenAPI (formerly
known as Swagger). I’ll discuss the benefits, how to generate a
beautiful HTML documentation for your API, and how you can
effortlessly make calls to your services. In the second part of the
talk I'll discuss and tell you how to overcome challenges you might
face when running OpenAPI in production, gathered from over a year of
heavy usage at Yelp for hundreds of services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OpenAPI initiative is a cross-vendor consortium focused on
creating, evolving and promoting a vendor neutral description format.
As an open governance structure under the Linux Foundation, its
members include Google, IBM, Atlassian and PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;
