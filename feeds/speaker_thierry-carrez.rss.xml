[EuroPython 2016]

[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/how-openstack-makes-python-better-and-vice-versa"&gt;https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/how-openstack-makes-python-better-and-vice-versa&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is an infrastructure stack mostly developed in Python. In
this talk, Thierry Carrez and Doug Hellmann, both Python Software
Foundation fellows and OpenStack Technical Committee members, will
look at the symbiotic relationship between OpenStack and Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is an open source stack that can be deployed on raw
computing resources to privately or publicly present Infrastructure as
a Service. It now consists of more than 4.5 million lines of code, 85%
of which is Python. In this talk, Thierry Carrez and Doug Hellmann,
both Python Software Foundation fellows and OpenStack Technical
Committee members, will look at the symbiotic relationship between
OpenStack and Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll go back in history and explain why OpenStack originally picked
Python as its main language 6 years ago, and explore what does Python
bring to OpenStack. We'll dive into examples of OpenStack pushing
Python libraries to their limits and exposing new bugs. We'll look
into the massive cloud-based continuous integration system that
OpenStack uses and explain how it exposes bugs in Python libraries in
the minutes after they are published to PyPI. We'll look into Python
libraries that were created by the OpenStack community and libraries
that the OpenStack community took over. Finally we'll expose a few
best practices that Python developers can follow to get the most of
this symbiotic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is an innovative open source project written in Python, backed
by Rackspace Hosting and NASA, building a massively-scalable and
reliable cloud computing platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of this talk will clarify the place of OpenStack in the
general &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot; landscape and explain why a fully open cloud
infrastructure stack is necessary to avoid vendor lock-in. We'll then
focus on the OpenStack project goals, its developer community, its open
design and release processes, and the developer tools it chose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the talk will present into more technical details the
different components of OpenStack: Nova (compute) and Swift (storage),
including the Python libraries that are used (libvirt, SQLAlchemy,
eventletâ€¦). A Q&amp;amp;A session at the end of the talk will give the audience
a chance to clear any remaining dark area.&lt;/p&gt;
