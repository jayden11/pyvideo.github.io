I'll describe my original intentions, symptoms, how I eventually discovered the mistake, and possibly even a solution.

&lt;p&gt;In this humbling talk, I'll describe some mistakes I've made in working in statistics and machine learning. I'll describe my original intentions, symptoms, how I eventually discovered the mistake, and possibly even a solution. The topics include mistakes in A/B testing, Kaggle competitions, data collection, and other fields. I'll also introduce some interesting statistical and machine learning counterexamples: examples where our original intuition fails, and solutions to these examples.&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk, Cam will use Python as a data analysis tool to explore Python developers and code. With millions of data points, mostly scraped from Github and Stackoverflow, we'll reexamine who the Python developer is, and how Python developers write code.&lt;/p&gt;
