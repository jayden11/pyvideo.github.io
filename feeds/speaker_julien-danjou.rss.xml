It offers highly-scalable data storage for measurements and provides access to its data via a REST API.In this lecture, we'll discuss the features the project is offering to its users, and how they can easily be leveraged in any application. In a second part, we'll see how the project has been built to scale, how Python was leveraged and made scalable.&lt;/p&gt;

language on top of Python. It The project has been started this year,
and is making good progress, since a lot of code can already be
executed. Compatibility with Python is one of its core attribute, and in
this regard it follows the path that Clojure took with Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will present you what Hy is, how it works internally
(briefly), what you can accomplish with it, how to contribute, and
obviously how to write code with it!&lt;/p&gt;
