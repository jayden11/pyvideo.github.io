software for over a decade now. Nevertheless, developers in Zimbabwe
have done little in terms of developing an active and vibrant open
source community until 2015 which saw the establishment of PyZim. This
is because affiliation to professional bodies is not heavily emphasized
in most industries, especially the ICT industry. The economic challenges
facing the country for the past two decades have also made affiliation
to such organisations a luxury as the country has over 90% unemployment
rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this background, it is no surprise that setting up a vibrant
Python user group has been fraught with many challenges. In my talk, I
intent to share the journey we have traveled in setting up PyZim. I will
also share our experiences organising Django Girls workshops and PyCon
Zimbabwe 2016. I will also share with the audience the challenges faced,
opportunities arising, benefits accrued and important lessons learnt
through the experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
