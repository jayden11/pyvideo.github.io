My talk is aiming to introduce the audience to the 'magicness' of the OpenStack SDK to develop applications that could use effectively all the features exposed. This talk is a way to evangelize people to use the proper tools and getting in touch with what's already out there instead to rewrite everything from scratch or reinvent the wheel. At the end of the talk the audience will see and 'touch' how easy is to write from scratch an application and make use of it, immediately using for example the trystack environment. Since the talk time is 30 minutes, there will be a template on github from what to start and at the end the working apps.&lt;/p&gt;
