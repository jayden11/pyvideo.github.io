&lt;p&gt;Python as a language for DeepLearning. Python is emerging as the facto language to specify Deep Learning Networks. In this talk we will explore some of the popular libraries like Tensorflow and Keras to see the semantics used to describe such networks and look a bit more under the hood at what is the python layer actually doing for these well known deep learning libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

in Python. We will cover some of the history of Neural Networks and
obstacles that were encountered in the 1990s. This will then lead onto
the developments in 2006 and 2012 that lead to the resurgence of
interest in Neural Networks and the rebranding of the field as Deep
Learning. These developments will be illustrated by means of an extended
example of building a classifier of hand written digits on the MNIST
dataset. We will start with a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron and then
build this up into a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder. All code will be
developed using the Keras framework and TensorFlow and can be run on a
simple laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
