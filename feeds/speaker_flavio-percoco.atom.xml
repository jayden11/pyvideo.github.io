Fornisce un sistema operativo scalabile e servizi quali: Image, Storage, Object, Computer, ecc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questo talk ha come obiettivo dare alla platea un overview su OpenStack, le sue caratteristiche, i suoi moduli, il coding style, il workflow e l'organizzazione.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come caso di successo di un prodotto con sviluppo guidato dalla comunità, è assolutamente un ottimo punto di riferimento per chiunque voglia intraprendere una strada simile, o entrare per collaborare in progetti simili.&lt;/p&gt;

Likewise, more and more people want to work remotely. I get asked quite often what it is like to work remotely, how I manage to respect deadlines and actually do some work. Many people think that working remotely is hard and that just a small set of folks can actually do it. This is not true!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working remotely is not just about getting things done. It's more about getting yourself to the point where you're able to get things done. Going remote forces people to deal with things like having a good place to work from, being comfortable, managing their own time, defining priorities themselves and having time for themselves as well. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter how hard people try not to procrastinate, one way or another, procrastination manages to fill a huge part of the time and you know what, THAT'S FINE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll share my experience as a remote developer, the things that have changed in my life since I stopped commuting every day and decided to be a prisoner of my own house. I'll go through the things I struggled with, the things I learned to deal with and how I embrace procrastination. This talk is a great opportunity for everyone to learn and share from real life experiences about this work arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From commuting to computing
Getting out of bed
First fears and troubles as a remotee
Baby steps towards enjoying a remote position
Missing the office and dealing with it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is a huge, open-source cloud provider. One of the main tenets of OpenStack is the (Shared Nothing Architecture) to which all modules stick very closely. In order to do that, services within OpenStack have adopted different strategies to integrate themselves and share data without sacrificing performance nor moving away from SNA. This strategies are not applicable just to OpenStack but to any distributed system. Sharing data, regardless what that data is, is a must-have requirement of any successful cloud service. This talk will present some of the existing integration strategies that are applicable to cloud infrastructures and enterprise services. The talk will be based on the strategies that have helped OpenStack to be successful and most importantly, scalable.&lt;/p&gt;

I get asked quite often what it is like to work remotely, how I manage to respect deadlines and actually do some work. Many people think that working remotely is hard and that just a small set of folks can actually do it. This is not true! Working remotely is not just about getting things done.

&lt;div class="section" id="details"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Details&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the lines of what I've described in the abstract, the presentation
will walk the audience through the state of the art of existing system
integration solutions, the ones that have been adopted by OpenStack and
the benefits of those solutions. At the end of the talk, a set of
solutions under development, ideas and improvements to the existing ones
will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation is oriented to distributed services, fault-tolerance
and replica determinism. It's based on a software completely written in
python and running successfully on several production environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will be split in 3 main topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="distributed-system-integration"&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Distributed System integration&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's it ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is it essential for cloud infrastructures?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing methods and strategies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="openstack-success-story"&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;OpenStack success story&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which methods did OpenStack adopt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How / Why do they work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What else could be done?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="coming-next"&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Coming Next&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some issues of existing solutions&lt;/li&gt;

you’re not doing it), how would you feel about it? Would you be
motivated enough to take off your laptop and start coding? Or would you
rather do something else? Programming is more about other things than
just coding. Great books - like The Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler
- have eloquently explained the different perspectives there are about
what programming is and how you can take the most out of your skills.
Nonetheless, programming is even more than that. Programming is more
than just producing results and it’s definitely more than just being
“smart”. In fact, programming is probably more about how to keep
programming than actually doing it. Likely, one of the things we,
developers, struggle the most with is motivation. Therefore, join me in
this talk while I share some of my motivational ups and downs and walk
you through some of the things that have worked for me along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of them are meant to
last long and some others aren't. There's a moment in every community
where it needs to outgrow itself, expand its limits and aim way higher
than ever. This is no necesarily related to its goals but the ecosystem
it needs to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a community has gone beyond its limits, the community members,
consumers and leaders will have to keep up with its pace. How do we help
it to remain sane? How do we keep our goals on track while allowing for
further growth? How do we allow it to keep expanding without further
damaging the community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all questions we ask ourselves everyday in the OpenStack
community and that we've managed to work on without killing ourselves on
the way.&lt;/p&gt;
