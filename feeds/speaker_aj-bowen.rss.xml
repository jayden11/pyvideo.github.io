Use it to &amp;quot;build, ship, and run&amp;quot; containerized
applications! Learn how to implement logging, metrics, stateful
services, and more! Learn the True Way of DevOps! Alright, we can't
promise anything about the True Way of DevOps, but everything else will
definitely be in this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will run a demo app featuring Python components and see some best
practices to &amp;quot;Dockerize&amp;quot; Python code and Flask in particular; but the
tutorial also includes other languages and frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come with your laptop! You don't need to install anything before the
workshop, as long as you have a web browser and a SSH client. Each
student will have their own private cluster during the tutorial, to get
immediately applicable first-hand experience.&lt;/p&gt;
