development of mypy, a static type checker for Python, as a way to make
our multimillion-line Python codebase easier to understand, navigate,
and maintain. In this talk, we will discuss the benefits of type
annotations, explain how to use them, and give a peak into how mypy
works behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mypy is an open-source type-checker for Python which supports the PEP
484 standard for gradual typing. Originally created by Jukka Lehtosalo
as part of his PhD thesis in 2013, it is now under active development by
a small team at Dropbox which includes David Fisher, Greg Price, and
Guido van Rossum. It supports Python 3.2 and higher, as well as Python
2.7 (via type comments).&lt;/p&gt;
