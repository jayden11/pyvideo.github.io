&lt;p&gt;Intermediate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you continuously &amp;quot;integrating&amp;quot;, or just running some unit tests
inside a virtualenv?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go the Full Monty with OpenStack!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protagonists, in order of appearance: Gerrit, Jenkins, OpenStack,
Puppet, Odoo (formerly OpenERP). Enjoy the ride!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll show how we configured our CI tools to automatically build and
destroy entire servers on OpenStack. We'll have Gerrit for code review,
Jenkins for coordinating and monitoring the build process, OpenStack and
its tools to build servers on their own subnet, Puppet for configuring
said servers. The example project is an installation of Odoo (formely
OpenERP) with a web server and PostgreSQL database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Catalyst, my team works with Odoo (formerly known as OpenERP), a
modular Open Source suite of business applications. It has a very large
and complex codebase and &amp;quot;Regression&amp;quot; is its middle name. It is under
very active development on github, and customisations are generally
brought in via plugins that override or extend default functionality.
Basically, reasonable work on this requires continuous integration, it's
not a luxury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could have a fat build server with multiple virtualenvs and multiple
databases on the same PostgreSQL server, and just run some Python tests
and be done with it. We could improve that with something like LXC,
Vagrant etc. all happening on said build server. But why stop there -
why not go all the way and create a more realistic setup? After all,
another team is able to provide us with OpenStack. Let's go the Full
Monty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go hog wild and create and destroy entire servers just for the
purpose of testing. Let's have separate application and database
servers, just like in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's also keep some servers alive for other purposes, e.g., user
acceptance testing. Just sit in an IRC channel and after changes are
committed for review, wait for a bot to post the URL of the newly built
web server to click on. A nicely readable URL on a separate subdomain
that is, of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, I'll show how active upstream development on github fits
into all this, and how your Ubuntu &amp;quot;Precise Pangolin&amp;quot; server can easily
rehearse an upgrade to &amp;quot;Trusty Tahr&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
