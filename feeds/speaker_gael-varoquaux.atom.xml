Open
source, Python, and simple patterns were the way forward. Staying on top
of todays growing datasets is an arm race. Data analytics machinery
—clusters, NOSQL, visualization, Hadoop, machine learning, ...— can
spread a team's resources thin. Focusing on simple patterns, lightweight
technologies, and a good understanding of the applications gets us most
of the way for a fraction of the cost. These patterns appear underline
the design of Mayavi, for interactive 3D visualization, scikit-learn, for
easy machine learning, and joblib for out-of-core and parallel computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will present a personal perspective on ten years of scientific data
processing with Python. What are the emerging patterns in data
processing? How can modern data-mining ideas be used without a big
engineering team? What constraints and design trade-offs govern software
projects like scikit-learn, Mayavi, or joblib? How can we make the most
out of distributed hardware with simple framework-less code?&lt;/p&gt;

[EuroPython 2016]
[22 July 2016]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/keynote-science-web-dev"&gt;https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/keynote-science-web-dev&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science is a hot topic and  Python has emerged as an ideal language for it.
Its strength for data analysis come from the cultural mix between the scientific Python community, and more conventional software usage, such as web development or system administration. I'll show how and why Python is a easy and powerful tool for data science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python started as a scripting language, but now it is the new trend everywhere and in particular for data science, the latest rage of computing. It didn't get there by chance: tools and concepts built by nerdy scientists and geek sysadmins provide foundations for what is said to be the sexiest job: data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk I'll give a personal perspective, historical and technical, on the progress of the scientific Python ecosystem, from numerical physics to data mining. What made Python suitable for science; How could scipy grow to challenge commercial giants such as Matlab; Why the cultural gap between scientific Python and the broader Python community turned out to be a gold mine; How scikit-learn was born, what technical decisions enabled it to grow; And last but not least, how we are addressing a wider and wider public, lowering the bar and empowering people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will discuss low-level technical aspects, such as how the Python world makes it easy to move large chunks of number across code. It will touch upon current exciting developments in scikit-learn and joblib. But it will also talk about softer topics, such as project dynamics or documentation, as software's success is determined by people.&lt;/p&gt;
