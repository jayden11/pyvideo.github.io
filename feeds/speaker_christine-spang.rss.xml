How the Tor Project uses Python</title><link>http://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2012/4-how-the-tor-project-uses-python.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Tor client software itself is written in C, there's more to
the Tor project than just the core client. Come see how the Tor project
uses Python for network analysis, metrics, and various front- and
back-end services.&lt;/p&gt;

someone's written some code in another language that solves your
problem. What options do you have for interacting with this external
code from within your program? We'll examine how to call external
binaries, what happens behind the scenes at a systems level, and how
these implementation details affect performance and memory usage. In the
second part of the talk, we'll discuss the different options for more
tightly integrating external code in the form of a C library for better
performance and control.&lt;/p&gt;

And most of the time, the best way to find what you
want in a pile of data is to search it. In this project-based tutorial,
you'll get an introduction to the basic theory of search and write a
program to index and search a collection of Wikipedia documents using
the Whoosh library. You'll leave with the ability to add search
functionality to all of your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

database, but it's difficult to decide when to use them and when not
to---and what the alternatives are. In this talk you'll learn strategies
for deciding when and where to use an ORM, when to be cautious, and how
to tell that you're doing the right thing, drawn from real-world lessons
learned building the Inbox email platform.&lt;/p&gt;

Come take a deep dive into how
they work, from the big picture down to what goes over the wire,
including insight into the performance benefits of the protocol, via a
real-world example of how WebSockets are implemented client- and
server-side in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
