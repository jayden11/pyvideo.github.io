non-linear editor format, but as large collections of image sequences in
folders. Using Python to produce video this way can be very simple and
natural once you starting thinking in image sequences. Using a series of
small scripts, I'll demonstrate using PyCairo or PySVG as well as
ImageMagick and FFMPEG to make 1080P HD video.&lt;/p&gt;

TV DVB standard. It was discovered it can also be a general purpose
radio receiver and spectrum analyzer. We will evaluate these devices by
listening to broadcast FM or emergency frequencies, and demonstrate an
original open source Python library I wrote for them.&lt;/p&gt;
