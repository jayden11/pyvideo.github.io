and run many experiments before finding the optimal solution for the
problem they are trying to solve. However, sometimes, a lot of the
knowledge gained in the process stays with the person. In this proposed
talk, I would like to introduce how to produce, share and ensure the
reproducibility of experiments using jupyter notebooks and github. This
is a series of lessons Iearned while being a research student (where
open-sourcing the code and data used to generate papers is very
important) and more recently, working in a new team in Zalando, where we
have experimented with different ways to share and review the data
science tasks, as well as the knowledge generated from those tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
