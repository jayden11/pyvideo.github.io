Python provides many useful data science tools (e.g. NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, etc.). Unfortunately, they don't work well together, one of the bottlenecks is the inefficiency of loading MongoDB data into NumPy array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss the concerns for creating operational data analytic pipelines, introduce Monary as alternative for loading data into NumPy, and give examples of accessing data with Monary, as well as how to build scalable data analysis pipelines using these open source tools.&lt;/p&gt;

particularly so for competitions like those hosted by Kaggle. This talk
will provide an introduction to the technique, a short historical recap
and then focus on the existing libraries in Python that allow you to use
this general family. It'll work through the advantages and disadvantage
of specific libraries using worked examples. The code and slides will be
in Github. The end learning of attendees will be sufficient knowledge to
understand when to use this technique and what is the most appropriate
Python library for their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
