mentors willing to help you. Various mentors have helped me navigate the
open source community and help advanced my skills. I realized finding a
mentor is not as easy as it seems, and it takes a lot of courage to
reach out in the first place. And then, there is impostor syndrome,
where one may feel like they donâ€™t deserve the help. In this talk, I
will provide advice about working with a mentor. Asking for help is not
a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
