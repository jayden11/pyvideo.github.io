&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyChart is a very nice program for producing print quality graphs.
However, it came equipped with a rather strange API, where every class
was called T. It was also using the global namespace in strange and
disturbing ways. Furthermore, it mixed multiple distinct tasks in some
classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show how I went about refactoring the package in order to make a
nice and clean API. This talk is focused on teaching refactoring
methodology to beginner and intermediate level programmers. It will also
give a brief introduction to how to make beautiful graphs with PyChart.&lt;/p&gt;
