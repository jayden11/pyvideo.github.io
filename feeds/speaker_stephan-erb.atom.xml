[EuroPython 2015]
[22 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devpi is an open source PyPi-compatible package server. Its versatile
features make it the Swiss Army knife of Python package and release
management, enabling anyone to shape a custom release workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will detail how we use our company-wide Devpi
installation in order to share a large set of packages across teams,
deploy binary packages to our application servers, and mix and mash
open source packages with our own. With Devpi being a critical part of
our release and deployment infrastructure, I will also cover our high-
availability setup and how we perform major version updates with
minimal downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this talk is not meant to be an exhaustive introduction of all
available Devpi features, it can offer insights on how Devpi can be
used at a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;
