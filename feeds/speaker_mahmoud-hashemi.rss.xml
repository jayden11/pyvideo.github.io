If you've ever felt lost in or out of touch with the constant whirl of Python performance advancements, this practical talk will put it back into perspective.

Abstract
Performance is a complex topic. It means a lot of things to a lot of people. Python gives us a great starting point: strong primitives and the &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; philosophy. But is Python actually good enough for performance-critical applications?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk defines different kinds of performance, covers basic principles, and dives right into measurement. With those foundations laid, it outlines eight approaches to scaling Python, four of which are stack-agnostic and four of which are Python-specific. It outlines many examples from industry to promote a holistic view of performance as a practical process, not a large-scale benchmarking competition.&lt;/p&gt;
