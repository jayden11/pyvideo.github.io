&lt;p&gt;Technology professionals have been in high demand for several decades, and this demand for talent has caused a culture to emerge that often turns a blind eye to those who may be struggling with alcoholism and addiction. We have to come together to avoid this &amp;quot;petri dish&amp;quot; continuing to exist, by watching out for ourselves, and one another. The CDC estimates that ten percent of Americans suffer from the disease of addiction, and only nine percent of addicts ever receive treatment. This &amp;quot;petri dish&amp;quot; of technology culture makes it even harder for those of us with careers in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovery can be a wonderful journey for those of us who suffer from the disease, and I hope by sharing some of my journey, people will take a step back and consider what we can do to improve the culture for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content warnings: this will be frank discussion that may involve colorful language, and topics including drug and alcohol abuse, death from addiction and sexual abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
