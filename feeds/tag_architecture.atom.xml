&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In financial engineering and derivatives analytics, C/C++/Java/VBA and
other languages are still dominating. Visixion has developed with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dexision.com"&gt;DEXISION&lt;/a&gt; the first full fledged
derivatives analytics suite with Python as core language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEXISION is an On Demand application that is completely Open Source
based (LAMP). For derivatives valuation, it uses Monte Carlo simulation
- an approach known to be computationally demanding. However, Numpy
provides the performance and functionality needed to implement financial
simulation algorithms in a fast and compact manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk illustrates the architecture of our analytics suite and
demonstrates how to implement fast and compact simulation algorithms
with Python and Numpy. The talk shows that the Python/Numpy combination
reaches sufficient speed for productive financial applications -
something still widely doubted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[No prerequisites.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google App Engine is a unique hosting platform that lets you build
applications and run them in Google's data centers using the massive
global infrastructure built to run the Internet's most powerful company.
App Engine offers a development environment that uses familiar
technologies (Java and Python) and provides a powerful and robust set of
APIs to users while maintaining security and independence from other
apps running in the cloud. It is always free to get started so you can
try it out with no risk, and if you need additional computing resources,
you can purchase additional computing resources beyond the free quota
limits. (If you enable billing and trust us with your credit card, we
will extend your free quotas even further; you won't get charged until
you exceed those &lt;em&gt;extended&lt;/em&gt; quotas.) Scale your application to millions
of users and pay only for what you use at competitive market pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we provide an update of the newest features found in
the most recent releases of the App Engine platform. We also share some
suggestions for best practices to existing App Engine developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginners to the App Engine platform will be interested in the
introductory workshop which may be offered (see description below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google App Engine workshop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we'll give you a comprehensive introduction to the
platform in two/three components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-hour Introduction to Cloud computing and Google App Engine seminar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-hour App Engine hands-on workshop/codelab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first hour, we review Cloud Computing as an industry and where
Google App Engine fits into the picture. Specifically, we discuss App
Engine as a PaaS solution because of the inherent challenges of building
web and other applications. We'll outline the architecture of App
Engine, what it's major components are, introduce its features and APIs,
discuss the service and how it works (including information on the free
quotas), present some information about current users and usage,
including integration with Google Apps, and finally, give an overview of
its enterprise edition called Google App Engine for Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the approximately one-hour lecture, we'll show you how to create
applications that run on App Engine by building a simple but real web
application from the ground up via a hands-on coding laboratory.
Although based on the online tutorial, this codelab goes up and beyond
what's in the documentation: you will get a more detailed step-by-step
instructions to replicate that example as well as have the opportunity
to extend your application with some of the newer APIs that come with
App Engine. The codelab will cover the Users service, non-relational
Datastore, and Memcache APIs. Time-permitting, we'll also discuss some
of the newest features found in recent App Engine releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;rdflib is a python library implementing a database with various triples
back- end, parser, data serializers, SPARQL is a Python interface to
extract/insert triples. We integrated it in Django reusing the database
connection and exposing an ORM interface, along with full-text search on
literals. This presentation shows a django-rdflib case study with a
PostgreSQL backend in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://brancusi1.usc.edu"&gt;Brain Architecture Management
System&lt;/a&gt; - a neuroscientific project for the
University of Southern California. Benefits of the flexible RDF
structure will be shown, allowing researchers to insert free format
data, making data public with a customizable serialization and use the
powerful full-text search integrated in PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective: show attendees an effective combination of RDF, PostgreSQL
full- text search and Django ORM via django-rdflib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements: Django familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyF is a python framework to ease flow based programming and allow
massive data crunching on multiple CPUs. We boast an optional web-based
interface to visually design processing tubes, batch scheduling, report
generation and email alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Framework is easily extensible by writing plugins, a lot of features
like data persistence, reporting and web scrapping are already part of
the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will focus on an introduction to PyF architecture and
higher-level designer ui use and how it could be useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If available, an additional training session will focus on working with
the framework to create your own flow-based processes and plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;XMPP is an open technology for real-time communication. Although
primarily known for its application in the IM service &amp;quot;Jabber&amp;quot; (and,
subsequently, gchat/gtalk), it has numerous applications and creates new
opportunities for inter-system communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While researching for an alternative to webservices at Mendix, we came
across XMPP and realized it solved many of the shortcomings of
webservices. It is currently being used to handle all inter-system and
inter-process communication in the Mendix cloud hosting environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will give a general overview of what XMPP is, an introduction
to the sleekxmpp python library and how the core features of xmpp can
help an architecture scale well horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Required knowledge: basic understanding of hosting environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A completely misguided meme has long been going around: that Python
doesn't have, or need, any Design Patterns. This terrible meme may
spring from not realizing what the Gang Of Four state so plainly in
their historical &amp;quot;Design Patterns&amp;quot; book: which design patterns are
useful DOES depend on the programming language one targets - design is
NOT independent of implementation, as the epic-fail &amp;quot;Waterfall&amp;quot;
Methodology Pattern would suggest. What patterns apply to a design,
depends to some extent on what implementation technologies will be used
to realize that design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you focus on some &amp;quot;classic DPs&amp;quot; that are basically workarounds for
some other language's lack of garbage collection, or for a clumsy
static-typing system, those may indeed be worthless for Python. But many
other DPs are perfectly useful and applicable, and Python's strengths as
a language afford riffing on them to develop highly Pythonic, powerful,
productive variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I analyze some of my favorite pattern families - e.g.,
Template Method and its variants, Dependency Injection and its ilk,
Callback and friends - in a highly Pythonic context. Non-pattern Idioms,
and Patterns that aren't really Design Patterns but rather Architecture
or Methodology ones, make cameo appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals: remove from your system any residue of the pernicious meme about
Python not having or needing design patterns. Prereqs: experience
designing and developing software; intermediate-level Python knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Benno Rice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you've developed your application, it appears to work and you may
even have some tests to back that up. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One part of software development that tends to receive not nearly enough
attention is the process of deploying, supporting and maintaining your
code in production. This demonstration will give an overview of using
tools such as Hudson, nose, stdeb and freshen to automate the testing,
packaging, deployment and verification of production software.&lt;/p&gt;

code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dr. Greg Turner (the Interaction Consortium)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our web development work for Galleries, Libraries, Archives
and Museums (the so-called GLAM sector), we have open-sourced the common
tools and design patterns that we have developed as a web framework
called GLAMkit (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://glamkit.org/"&gt;http://glamkit.org/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLAMkit is based on Django, and is inspired by its design philosophy of
several apps which implement specific features. However, by looking at
the successes and challenges faced by other CMSes and collections of
apps such as Pinax, we have taken the philosophy a stage futher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than being a collection of Django apps, we have constructed
GLAMkit as a collection of optional and reusable Django 'toolkits' for
implementing common features. We leave the implementation details - the
things that Django already does brilliantly - to the application
developers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will present the history of GLAMkit's development, with
particular focus on how our approach to reusability came about, and some
examples of that approach.&lt;/p&gt;
