faced by a new, disruptive technology, when adoption moves from
innovators and visionaries into the mainstream. Test Driven Development
is clearly a disruptive technology, that changes the way you approach
software design and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;TDD hasn't yet been embraced by everyone, but is it just a matter of
time? Ten years from now, will a non-TDD practicing developer experience
the horror of being labelled a technology adoption 'laggard', and be
left working exclusively on dreadfully boring legacy systems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be a smart move to get down to your nearest Coding Dojo and
practice TDD on some Code Katas. On the other hand, the thing with
disruptive technologies is that even they can become disrupted when
something better comes along. What about Property-Based Testing?
Approval Testing? Outside-In Development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'd like to look at the chasm-crossing potential of TDD
and some related technologies. My aim is that both you and I will still
be able to get a good job in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
