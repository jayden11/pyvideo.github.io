different axes, attribute matching, string functions, EXSLT extensions
plus a few other handy patterns like CSS selectors and Javascript
parsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you need to extract data from web pages, you usually parse HTML
documents into a DOM tree and then use libraries like BeautifulSoup or
the ElementTree API to extract data from it. Some libraries also support
XPath expressions which can express more complex traversal and search
patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything about XPath 1.0 is defined in W3C lengthly specification but
it can be obscure to read at first. The basics are quite simple to grasp
though, and this talk will go over the most useful syntax patterns you
need to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we'll cover: - axes and how to look for specific tags, parent
element, children or siblings nodes - predicates and selecting nodes
based on attribute or content values - built-in string functions that
you should know about - EXSLT extensions supported by lxml and how they
can solve tricky lookups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll end the talk with a few handy tips: - how to use CSS selectors to
do some of the above - how to parse Javascript code with XPath&lt;/p&gt;
