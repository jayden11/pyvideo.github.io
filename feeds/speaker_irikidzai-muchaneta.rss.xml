sheet recognition project using Python, OpenCV and raspberry Pi.
Specifically, looking at detecting color poll-sheets in a classroom of
about 50 - 150 students. Much like how one can poll an audience of
people using a clicker technology and show the results of the audience
with regards to a question asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audience is anyone interested in computer vision, what computer
vision can do and achieve, as well as the hard work required to make
it all happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the talk the audience can have a glimpse into what it takes to
create a computer vision project, as well as the typical process and
algorithm one would follow in a simple task of creating a computer
vision project using python, opencv and raspberry pi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few aspects I will cover include:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer vision goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified overview of the algorithm used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going into a bit of detail where the challenges arise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example of the the project i worked on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results achieved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few global interesting projects around computer vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will end with a look into the python code involved and talk through
the results of the polling program, as well as any hard to detect areas
and how the system detects these. :)&lt;/p&gt;
