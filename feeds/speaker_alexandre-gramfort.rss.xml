(regression and classification). Linear models (e.g. Ridge, Logistic
Regression) are the simplest of these models. They have pratical
benefits such as interpretability and limited computation time while
offering the best performance for some applications. This talk will
cover the basics of these models with examples and demonstrate how they
can scale to datasets that do not fit in memory or how they can
incorporate simple polynomial non-linearities.&lt;/p&gt;
