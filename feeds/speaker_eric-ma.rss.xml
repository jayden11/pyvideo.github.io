This
tutorial is for you. Python packages &amp;amp; tools (IPython, scikit-learn,
NetworkX) are powerful for performing data analysis. However, little is
said about formulating the questions and tying these tools together to
provide a holistic view of the data. This tutorial will provide you with
an introduction on how this can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

LinkedIn make friend recommendations? Or how epidemiologists track down
patient zero in an outbreak? If so, then this tutorial is for you. Here,
we will explore a bike sharing data set as a way to understand the kinds
of problems that can be solved using graph analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
