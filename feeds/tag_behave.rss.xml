It feels like something always still goes wrong when your customers start to use your application. All your unit tests pass, so what is going on?

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behave is a tool for behaviour-driven development inspired by the
Cucumber tool for Ruby. It allows developers and stakeholders to agree
on how a particular piece of software should behave using an
English-like Given-When- Then syntax and for that behaviour for then to
be easily tested in whatever manner is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will provide an introduction to behaviour-driven
development, behaviour testing in general and the behave tool along with
its advantages over alternatives such as lettuce and freshen.&lt;/p&gt;
