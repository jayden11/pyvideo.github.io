All the leading
search engine exploit knowledge graph to provide more accurate result to
user, e.g. Bing, Google, Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, the speaker will demonstrate how to build a searchable
knowledge graph from scratch. Lots of python tools will be applied
during the process. The process includes data wrangling, graph entity
indexing, full text search and web visualization. The data sources are
from dbpedia.org. Enormous amount of entities are collected and stored
to graph database for relationship querying and full text search engine
for searching. In the web visualization, a searchable interface and
visualized result demonstrate the knowledgable information to customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Lai is a Python fan, and his interested topics are natural
language processing and machine learning. He specializes in combining
machine learning algorithm and cloud computing technology to do big data
analysis, building application services.&lt;/p&gt;
