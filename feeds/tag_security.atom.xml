&lt;p&gt;Come join us by the fire as we have Security Story Time with our friends, Frog and Toad. With them, you'll learn about all the things Django does to protect users and developers out of the box. We'll look at simplified code samples from the Django codebase to see what's happening under the hood, and cover how to make the Django security model even stronger in your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've got data: lots of it. People want to get their hands on that data. You don't want that, so let's go over a few things you can do to dissuade attackers from getting their grubby mitts on your hard processed datastore. We'll cover the obvious things (spoiler alert: encryption) and then some advanced techniques for keeping data secure while still keeping it usable (that is to say, analyzable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django is arguably the most secure web framework. The Django team have
done an excellent job making secure-by-default decisions for our web
applications in many situations. Still, the last mile in development is
where the bulk of security vulnerabilities can be introduced and
Django's powerful flexibility allows for plenty of rope for developers
to hang themselves. Understanding the vulnerabilities that can be
created by common mistakes or misconceptions and overlooked details in
development will be useful for any Django user.&lt;/p&gt;

We have AppSec, OpSec, and
InfraSec teams, and our web developers have baked our security best
practices into documentation and a Django app called Funfactory. Hear
how we came to those best practices, what they are, and how to follow
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privacy and security are key parts of Mozilla's mission, and we build
some of the largest Django applications on the web, so being at the
absolutely forefront of security is crucial to us. And having a great
user experience is, too. So over the past few years, we've developed a
number of proposals, tools --like Bleach and django-ratelimit--and best
practices, and we've wrapped these up into our application template
Playdoh and an app called Funfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll share those best practices and their motivations. We'll also go
over a number of tools, settings, and even some fairly new web standard
proposals (with tools, of course) to help you build the most secure
Django applications you can, at whatever scale you're building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;sqlmap&amp;quot; is one of the largest, widely used and most active Python
projects in the IT security community (more than 2000 commits in one
year period with community of over 100 active testers). It combines it's
developers' strong security knowledge together with analytical,
mathematical and Python development skills to provide IT professionals
with vibrant features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk would be consisted of several parts: short introduction to project
and developers, developing and testing environment, programming cycle,
program's workflow, technologies used, common pitfalls and how we've
circumvent them, usage of mathematical models, optimizations, project's
future goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significant part of this talk would be the immediate insight into
the developing process of probably the world's most advanced open-source
Python IT security project today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google App Engine is a unique hosting platform that lets you build
applications and run them in Google's data centers using the massive
global infrastructure built to run the Internet's most powerful company.
App Engine offers a development environment that uses familiar
technologies (Java and Python) and provides a powerful and robust set of
APIs to users while maintaining security and independence from other
apps running in the cloud. It is always free to get started so you can
try it out with no risk, and if you need additional computing resources,
you can purchase additional computing resources beyond the free quota
limits. (If you enable billing and trust us with your credit card, we
will extend your free quotas even further; you won't get charged until
you exceed those &lt;em&gt;extended&lt;/em&gt; quotas.) Scale your application to millions
of users and pay only for what you use at competitive market pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we provide an update of the newest features found in
the most recent releases of the App Engine platform. We also share some
suggestions for best practices to existing App Engine developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginners to the App Engine platform will be interested in the
introductory workshop which may be offered (see description below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google App Engine workshop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we'll give you a comprehensive introduction to the
platform in two/three components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-hour Introduction to Cloud computing and Google App Engine seminar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-hour App Engine hands-on workshop/codelab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first hour, we review Cloud Computing as an industry and where
Google App Engine fits into the picture. Specifically, we discuss App
Engine as a PaaS solution because of the inherent challenges of building
web and other applications. We'll outline the architecture of App
Engine, what it's major components are, introduce its features and APIs,
discuss the service and how it works (including information on the free
quotas), present some information about current users and usage,
including integration with Google Apps, and finally, give an overview of
its enterprise edition called Google App Engine for Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the approximately one-hour lecture, we'll show you how to create
applications that run on App Engine by building a simple but real web
application from the ground up via a hands-on coding laboratory.
Although based on the online tutorial, this codelab goes up and beyond
what's in the documentation: you will get a more detailed step-by-step
instructions to replicate that example as well as have the opportunity
to extend your application with some of the newer APIs that come with
App Engine. The codelab will cover the Users service, non-relational
Datastore, and Memcache APIs. Time-permitting, we'll also discuss some
of the newest features found in recent App Engine releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Ivan Beschastnikh, Justin Samuel, and Justin Cappos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seattle is an open-source platform for developing and deploying
networked applications. Core feature of Seattle is that it allows safe
execution of untrusted code on end-user systems. In our talk we look at
how we used Python to build a safe, restricted code execution
environment for Seattle that not only provides execution safety but also
enforces strict resource consumption limits. In addition, Seattle
includes a high-level API to hide inconsistent OS-specific behaviors
from developers. What results is a platform that welcomes the
participation of end-user machines for general-purpose distributed
programming and creates new possibilities for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Geremy Condra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python's dynamic nature, large standard library, and concern for beauty
over performance make it an elegant and uniquely easy to use language,
but they also cause some unique problems. In this talk we'll explore how
features ranging from dictionaries to duck typing can become security
risks, demonstrate those attacks on real Python projects, and examine
how you can protect yourself and your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, an increasing body of evidence has accumulated
indicating that even when a system is hardened enough to provide strong
guarantees about its high-level behavior, implementation details and
especially performance properties can still provide attackers with an
easy way in. For Python, this is especially problematic: its generally
high-level view and the emphasis placed on flexibility often mean that
it can be difficult to stop attackers from gaining a foothold, while its
comparatively low execution speed increases the efficacy of wide variety
of implementation and timing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help Pythonistas understand and cope with these problems, we've
divided this talk into two parts: in the first, we demonstrate the
attacks against a series of widely-deployed Python projects with the
goal of both improving awareness about the issue and demonstrating
common weaknesses to be avoided. The second demonstrates effective
countermeasures and alternative constructions with the goal of improving
defenders' odds of spotting and correcting these flaws in their own
code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Geremy Condra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an attacker's point of view there are few entry points with as much
to offer as a vulnerable software updater, yet history tells us that
such vulnerabilities are common. In this talk we'll demonstrate a number
of attacks, explain how common approaches fail to defend against them,
and demonstrate a pure Python library (TUF) that provides both robust
protection and extreme ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulnerabilities in software update systems expose users to huge range of
potential security risks, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freeze attacks,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix-and-match attacks,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rollback attacks, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endless data attacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part of this talk, we'll demonstrate each of these against
real- world software updaters and explain how commonly used
countermeasures fail in application. We'll then move on to the second
part of the talk, demonstrating TUF, its internals, and the mechanisms
it uses to additionally defend against key compromise. Finally, we'll
demonstrate how easy it is to integrate TUF into your application and
its lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
