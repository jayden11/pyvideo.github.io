&lt;p&gt;Digital forensics would be a whole different ballgame without Python - the basis for most of the tools used. But what do these tools do, and why are they so important? This talk looks to teach a little about digital forensics, and then use that as a springboard to discuss the importance of Python in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

Virus? There’s an app for that. Malware? There’s an app for that. Social engineering? It's a little more complicated. These techniques, used by hackers to gather information on their target, are hard to combat without education - so why don’t we talk about them more often? Aimed at the average user who could be targeted by such an attack, this talk discusses the tools of social engineering, how it can be combated and why so many companies fail in preparing their employees for such an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
