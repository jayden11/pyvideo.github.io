&lt;p&gt;Theano is used to build large-scale Machine Learning systems ---in particular Deep Learning Networks---and targets operations to GPU hardware, which achieves significant performance improvements over the same operations performed on a CPU (say using Numpy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will present an overview of the Theano library and introduce its main features using some simple examples.&lt;/p&gt;

challenges. One of these is the detection of duplicate product records
within the platform, where different tenants input the same product
using different product descriptions. Commonly referred to as
the_Record Linkage_problem in Machine Learning, the task is to group
together similar product records under a single canonical identifier,
which is useful for business intelligence purposes and for product
search etc. The kernel of the solution is the computation of an
~O(n**2) all-pairs similarity join, where the runtime explodes
quadratically with an increase in input. At Zalando's Fashion Insight
Centre in Dublin we are looking at solutions to this problem that work
at scale (i.e., more than one million products). For our particular
problem, which involves Categorical Data (cosine similarity will not
work here), we employ a data-driven similarity measure and approximate
the similarity join using a two-step approach. In this talk we introduce
the standard approaches to the problem and illustrate our work-to-date
using Python.&lt;/p&gt;
