Wondering how to repeatably pull
together collections of packages into standalone development, testing
and deployment environments, all while managing inter-dependencies? In
this participatory tutorial, we'll start with distutils, walk through
using eggs in the cheeseshop and creating your own eggs, touch a bit on
using virtualenv to set up a development environment, and then dig into
using zc.buildout to rigorously control assembly specifications, with
build recipes, versioning and dependency management. We'll close by
showing how to create your own recipes. Attendees are strongly
encouraged to bring a laptop or partner with someone who does.&lt;/p&gt;
