configure and with many extensions built-in. This talk will quickly
introduce the basics of Ansible, then some real-life experience tips on
how to use this tool, from setting up dev VMs to multi-server setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure/Scaling is a topic really close to me, I'd like to have
the chance to talk about how we set this up in the company I work for.
Our infrastructure is around 10-15 servers, provisioned on different
cloud providers, so a good size infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presentation is going to be divided in 3 parts, first part is going to
be focused on comparing sysadmin and devops, then there will be an
introduction to the basic concepts of Ansible. I want to spend most on
the last part, which is going to give some tips based on our experience
with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many ideas will come from this presentation
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://speakerdeck.com/fmarani/devops-with-ansible"&gt;https://speakerdeck.com/fmarani/devops-with-ansible&lt;/a&gt; which i gave at
DJUGL in London, with a longer session I will have more chances to delve
into more detail, especially on how we use it, from vagrant boxes setup
to AWS and DigitalOcean boxes, network configuration, software
configurations, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to offer as many real-life tips as possible, without going too
much offtopic as far as Ansible is concerned&lt;/p&gt;
