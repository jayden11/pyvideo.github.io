&lt;p&gt;Presented by Ian Bicking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covers why are we doing what we're doing and why it matters in terms of
Open Source and the movement. Focuses on the Django community, what's
being produced and finding meaning in that.&lt;/p&gt;

one that has existed since our paths started crossing. We'll talk about
how to be mindful of design in your own open source project and how to
attract designers to help your project become even more awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an ever present rift between designers and developers and it is
one that has existed since our paths started crossing. While it has
almost become a requirement for designers to be able to grok the code
they work with on a daily basis, that has unfortunately had no effect on
the willingness of designers to work on open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, if your project is in need of a designer, there are ways
that you can make your project more appealing to our “special breed” of
personality. In this quick talk, we’ll jump into the mind of your
typical designer, show you just how many similarities we share and then
apply that knowledge to make your project easy and appealing for
designers to jump into.&lt;/p&gt;

Margherita &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will introduce ParaView, an open source application
developed by researchers around the world for parallel visualization and
analysis of large scale datasets, which in can be used to visualize and
analyze terabytes of data in real time. ParaView’s core algorithms are
implemented in C/C++ but all its major functionality can be scripted
from python with ease. I’ll give a short introduction to AstroViz, a
parallel visualization tool for astrophysical simulations implemented as
an opensource plugin to ParaView, which I have been lead developer on
since 2009. The focus of the talk will be on driving ParaView from
within python however, both general out of the box use and customized
extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have access to several parallel supercomputers so if there’s a
huge dataset we as a crowd would like to tackle visualizing during the
course of the week that would be fun project. The end of the talk will
be a short brainstorm of cool applications of analysis and visualization
of large scale datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

source project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented by Grant Paton-Simpson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overview of an open source Python project. Will cover wxPython (GUI
toolkit) plus graphics generally; quirks of different databases; making
python installer packages; using Sourceforge, Freshmeat, and Launchpad
(and Bazaar); and promoting the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOFA Statistics (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sofastatistics.com/"&gt;http://www.sofastatistics.com/&lt;/a&gt;) is an open source
desktop Python application with an emphasis on ease of use, learn as you
go, and beautiful output. The talk will cover technical aspects of the
project as well as project management issues. Specific areas covered
will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the cross-platform GUI toolkit wxPython (including wxWebKit and
the grid widgets) plus initial exploration of Matplotlib and Raphael
(Javascript and SVG)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience using different database engines including SQLite, MySQL,
MS Access, and MS SQL Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issues with standard statistics modules e.g. in SciPy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making python installer packages – currently only deb packages and
Windows installers (using NSIS). Plus managing releases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Sourceforge, Freshmeat, and Launchpad (including Bazaar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promoting the project through blogging, answering posts e.g. Ubuntu,
wikipedia, special aggregator lists and reviews, presentations,
articles, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions are very welcome as this is a very broad topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]&lt;/p&gt;
