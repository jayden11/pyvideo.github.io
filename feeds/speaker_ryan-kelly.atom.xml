their web services with two python-based tools: Marteau, a web-based UI
for easily running load tests, and Vaurien, a misbehaving TCP proxy that
can simulate various backend failures. Used together, these tools help
ensure a service will not only scale up to meet demand, but will fail
gracefully if it reaches breaking point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#64; Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Sunday, 08 Sep 2013 - Track 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intermediate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you've built an awesome webapp, put it through its paces, and assured
yourself that it does what it's supposed to do. Great! Now how does it
behave when things start to go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will demonstrate how the Mozilla Services team tests for
failure scenarios in our web services, focusing on two key python-based
tools: Marteau, a web-based frontend for easily running load-tests and
analyzing the results, and Vaurien, a misbehaving TCP proxy that can
simulate a variety of backend failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used together, these tools can help ensure that a web service will not
only scale up to meet its expected demand, but will fail gracefully when
it finally reaches breaking point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-life examples of bugs that only show up when your app is under
load; bugs that can turn a brief partial outage into a cascading
whole-system failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The basics of writing a load-testing suite for your app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to set up Marteau for easy on-demand load testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use Vaurien to simulate various kinds of backend failure, such
as an overloaded database, misconfigured DNS, or a
suddenly-disappearing job queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some tips for systematically applying these tools to your own setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyPy.js is an experiment in building a fast and compliant in-browser
python interpreter, by compiling PyPy into javascript and retargeting
its JIT to emit asmjs code at runtime. This talk will demonstrate the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyPy.js is an experiment in building a fast, compliant, in-browser
python interpreter. By compiling the PyPy interpreter into javascript,
and retargeting its JIT compiler to emit asmjs code at runtime, it is
possible to run python code in the browser at speeds competitive with a
native python environment. This talk will demonstrate the combination of
technologies that make such a thing possible, the results that have been
achieved so far, and the challenges that still remain when trying to
take python onto javascript's home turf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll cover: an overview of PyPy and why it's a good fit for this type
of project; an introduction to asmjs and the rise of javascript as a
compile target; what it looks like when you smoosh these two
technologies together; a comparison with other approaches such as
brython; and some concrete suggestions for how the result might be
useful in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you enjoy writing test cases for your web application? If so then
this may not be the talk for you. I'm going to show you how to make a
single test suite perform triple testing duty, so you can get on with
writing the fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I'll show you how to use WebTest to construct a simple functional
testsuite for your application. By running in-process against a WSGI
callable, the tests can be fast and light enough to form part of your
regularly-executed suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we'll use WSGIProxy to turn this into a deployment/acceptance
test script that you can point at a real live server to verify its
behaviour. Run this after every deployment to make sure you haven't
broken something in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll connect the suite to FunkLoad and pummel the server with
a distributed barrage of tests, to see how it copes under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

py2exe over your code. Want to deploy automatic updates? Want to be sure
it runs on legacy platforms? Want to add professional touches like code
signing? And want to do this all in a cross-platform manner? This talk
will show you the tools you can use to make your frozen apps better in a
variety of small yet important ways.&lt;/p&gt;
