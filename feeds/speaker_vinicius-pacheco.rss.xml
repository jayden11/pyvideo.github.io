[EuroPython 2016]
[19 July 2016]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/apis-and-microservices-with-go"&gt;https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/apis-and-microservices-with-go&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we show how the Go language helped us get a high
performance in a concise and simple API. Everything will be
exemplified using the backdrop of a real case of Globo.com: API
registrations. We will see how we went from 200 to 19,000 records per
second to the impacts of this rapid growth and the consequences of Go
of use. We also show how our microservices architecture was used in
the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about Go, software architecture and parallelism. How we
went from legacy, complex and slow software to new, speed, resilient
and maintainable software.
I'll start the talk showing the problemas and the challenges that my
team had received. After that, I'll show the tests, tests of
performance and the options that we did considering technologies and
strategies of development. The difficulties and problems also will be
show. Also I talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goroutines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resilient patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we leave of the Java ecosystem to new free ecosystem with
microservices and how Go help us.&lt;/p&gt;
